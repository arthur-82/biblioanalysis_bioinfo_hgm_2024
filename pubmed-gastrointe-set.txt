TI  - Integrated microbiome and metabolome analysis reveals a novel interplay between 
      commensal bacteria and metabolites in colorectal cancer.

AB  - Rationale: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor with the third highest 
      morbidity rate among all cancers. Driven by the host's genetic makeup and 
      environmental exposures, the gut microbiome and its metabolites have been 
      implicated as the causes and regulators of CRC pathogenesis. We assessed human 
      fecal samples as noninvasive and unbiased surrogates to catalog the gut 
      microbiota and metabolome in patients with CRC. Methods: Fecal samples collected 
      from CRC patients (CRC group, n = 50) and healthy volunteers (H group, n = 50) 
      were subjected to microbiome (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and metabolome (gas 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry, GC-MS) analyses. The datasets were analyzed 
      individually and integrated for combined analysis using various bioinformatics 
      approaches. Results: Fecal metabolomic analysis led to the identification of 164 
      metabolites spread across 40 metabolic pathways in both groups. In addition, 
      there were 42 and 17 metabolites specific to the H and CRC groups, respectively. 
      Sequencing of microbial diversity revealed 1084 operational taxonomic units 
      (OTUs) across the two groups, and there was less species diversity in the CRC 
      group than in the H group. Seventy-six discriminatory OTUs were identified for 
      the microbiota of H volunteers and CRC patients. Integrated analysis correlated 
      CRC-associated microbes with metabolites, such as polyamines (cadaverine and 
      putrescine). Conclusions: Our results provide substantial evidence of a novel 
      interplay between the gut microbiome and metabolome (i.e., polyamines), which is 
      drastically perturbed in CRC. Microbe-associated metabolites can be used as 
      diagnostic biomarkers in therapeutic explorations.

PG  - 146-58
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301805 [doi]
AB  - Advances in sequencing technology and the development of metagenomic and 
      bioinformatics methods have opened up new ways to investigate the 10(14) 
      microorganisms inhabiting the human gut. The gene composition of human gut 
      microbiome in a large and deeply sequenced cohort highlighted an overall 
      non-redundant genome size 150 times larger than the human genome. The in silico 
      predictions based on metagenomic sequencing are now actively followed, compared 
      and challenged using additional 'omics' technologies. Interactions between the 
      microbiota and its host are of key interest in several pathologies and applying 
      meta-omics to describe the human gut microbiome will give a better understanding 
      of this crucial crosstalk at mucosal interfaces. Adding to the growing 
      appreciation of the importance of the microbiome is the discovery that numerous 
      phages, that is, viruses of prokaryotes infecting bacteria (bacteriophages) or 
      archaea with a high host specificity, inhabit the human gut and impact microbial 
      activity. In addition, gene exchanges within the gut microbiota have proved to be 
      more frequent than anticipated. Taken together, these innovative exploratory 
      technologies are expected to unravel new information networks critical for gut 
      homeostasis and human health. Among the challenges faced, the in vivo validation 
      of these networks, together with their integration into the prediction and 
      prognosis of disease, may require further working hypothesis and collaborative 
      efforts.

AB  - Advances in technological and bioinformatics approaches have led to the 
      generation of a plethora of human gut metagenomic datasets. Metabolomics has also 
      provided substantial data regarding the small metabolites produced and modified 
      by the microbiota. Comparatively, the microbial enzymes mediating the 
      transformation of metabolites have not been intensively investigated. Here, we 
      discuss the recent efforts and technologies used for discovering and mining 
      enzymes from the human gut microbiota. The wealth of knowledge on metabolites, 
      reactions, genome sequences, and structures of proteins, may drive the 
      development of strategies for enzyme mining. Ongoing efforts to annotate gut 
      microbiota enzymes will explain catalytic mechanisms that may guide the clinical 
      applications of the gut microbiome for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Metaproteomics, as a subfield of proteomics, has quickly emerged as a pivotal 
      tool for global characterization of a microbiome system at a functional level. It 
      has been increasingly applied in studying human digestive and metabolic diseases, 
      and provides information-rich data to identify the dysbiosis of human gut 
      microbiome related to healthy or disease states to elucidate the molecular events 
      underlying host-microbiota interplays. While significant technical challenges 
      still exist, this emerging technology has been demonstrated to provide essential 
      information in interrogating functional changes in the human gut microbiome, 
      complementary to metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. This chapter overviews the 
      overall metaproteomic work flow and its recent applications in studying human gut 
      microbiome relevant to digestive and metabolic diseases.

AB  - Recent evidence has suggested that the gut microbiome is involved in human health 
      and diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, liver cirrhosis, rheumatoid 
      arthritis, and type 2 diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases, which are associated 
      with high morbidity and mortality across the world, are no exception. Increasing 
      evidence has suggested a strong relationship between the gut microbiome and the 
      progression of cardiovascular diseases. We first reported such a relationship 
      with coronary artery disease two years ago. Next-generation sequencing 
      techniques, together with bioinformatics technology, constantly and dramatically 
      expand our knowledge of the complex human gut bacterial ecosystem and reveal the 
      exact role of this bacterial ecosystem in cardiovascular diseases via the 
      functional analysis of the gut microbiome. Such knowledge may pave the way for 
      the development of further diagnostics and therapeutics for prevention and 
      management of cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the current review is to 
      highlight the relationship between the gut microbiome and their metabolites, and 
      the development of cardiovascular diseases by fostering an understanding of 
      recent studies.

AB  - Massive DNA sequencing studies have expanded our insights and understanding of 
      the ecological and functional characteristics of the gut microbiome. Advanced 
      sequencing technologies allow us to understand the close association of the gut 
      microbiome with human health and critical illnesses. In the future, analyses of 
      the gut microbiome will provide key information associating with human individual 
      health, which will help provide personalized health care for diseases. Numerous 
      molecular biological analysis tools have been rapidly developed and employed for 
      the gut microbiome researches; however, methodological differences among 
      researchers lead to inconsistent data, limiting extensive share of data. It is 
      therefore very essential to standardize the current methodologies and establish 
      appropriate pipelines for human gut microbiome research. Herein, we review the 
      methods and procedures currently available for studying the human gut microbiome, 
      including fecal sample collection, metagenomic DNA extraction, massive DNA 
      sequencing, and data analyses with bioinformatics. We believe that this review 
      will contribute to the progress of gut microbiome research in the clinical and 
      practical aspects of human health.

AB  - The human microbiome is one of the key factors affecting the host immune system 
      and metabolic functions that are not encoded in the human genome. 
      Culture-independent analysis of the human microbiome using metagenomics approach 
      allows us to investigate the compositions and functions of the human microbiome. 
      Computational methods analyze the microbial community by using specific marker 
      genes or by using shotgun sequencing of the entire microbial community. Taxonomy 
      profiling is conducted by using the reference sequences or by de novo clustering 
      of the specific region of sequences. Functional profiling, which is mainly based 
      on the sequence similarity, is more challenging since about half of ORFs 
      predicted in the metagenomic data could not find homology with known protein 
      families. This review examines computational methods that are valuable for the 
      analysis of human microbiome, and highlights the results of several large-scale 
      human microbiome studies. It is becoming increasingly evident that dysbiosis of 
      the gut microbiome is strongly associated with the development of immune disorder 
      and metabolic dysfunction.

AB  - Food and human health are inextricably linked. As such, revolutionary impacts on 
      health have been derived from advances in the production and distribution of food 
      relating to food safety and fortification with micronutrients. During the past 
      two decades, it has become apparent that the human microbiome has the potential 
      to modulate health, including in ways that may be related to diet and the 
      composition of specific foods. Despite the excitement and potential surrounding 
      this area, the complexity of the gut microbiome, the chemical composition of 
      food, and their interplay in situ remains a daunting task to fully understand. 
      However, recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, metabolomics profiling, 
      compositional analysis of food, and the emergence of electronic health records 
      provide new sources of data that can contribute to addressing this challenge. 
      Computational science will play an essential role in this effort as it will 
      provide the foundation to integrate these data layers and derive insights capable 
      of revealing and understanding the complex interactions between diet, gut 
      microbiome, and health. Here, we review the current knowledge on diet-health-gut 
      microbiota, relevant data sources, bioinformatics tools, machine learning 
      capabilities, as well as the intellectual property and legislative regulatory 
      landscape. We provide guidance on employing machine learning and data analytics, 
      identify gaps in current methods, and describe new scenarios to be unlocked in 
      the next few years in the context of current knowledge.

AB  - The Human Genome Project was completed a decade ago, leaving a legacy of process, 
      tools, and infrastructure now being turned to the study of the microbes that 
      reside in and on the human body as determinants of health and disease, and has 
      been branded "The Human Microbiome Project." Of the various niches under 
      investigation, the human gut houses the most complex and abundant microbial 
      community and is an arena for important host-microbial interactions that have 
      both local and systemic impact. Initial studies of the human microbiome have been 
      largely descriptive, a testing ground for innovative molecular techniques and new 
      hypotheses. Methods for studying the microbiome have quickly evolved from 
      low-resolution surveys of microbial community structure to high-definition 
      description of composition, function, and ecology. Next-generation sequencing 
      technologies combined with advanced bioinformatics place us at the doorstep of 
      revolutionary insight into the composition, capability, and activity of the human 
      intestinal microbiome. Renewed efforts to cultivate previously "uncultivable" 
      microbes will be important to the overall understanding of gut ecology. There 
      remain numerous methodological challenges to the effective study and 
      understanding of the gut microbiome, largely relating to study design, sample 
      collection, and the number of predictor variables. Strategic collaboration of 
      clinicians, microbiologists, molecular biologists, computational scientists, and 
      bioinformaticians is the ideal paradigm for success in this field. Meaningful 
      interpretation of the gut microbiome requires that host genetic and environmental 
      influences be controlled or accounted for. Understanding the gut microbiome in 
      healthy humans is a foundation for discovering its influence in various important 
      gastrointestinal and nutritional diseases (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, 
      diabetes, and obesity), and for rational translation to human health gains.

AB  - The central nervous system has essential role in the regulation of the 
      physiological condition of the human body. Gut microbes cause several types of 
      gastrointestinal diseases like ulcer stomach and intestine and irritable bowel 
      syndrome. Microbes present in the human gut can affect brain function by the 
      release of neuroactive metabolites such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and other 
      compounds. Gut microbial-derived metabolites also have an important role in 
      neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, etc. 
      Vital communication between the gut microbes and the central nervous system is 
      known as the microbiota-gut-brain axis. It provides a communication pathway 
      between the gut and brain which is made up of the vagus nerve, immune system 
      components, and neuroendocrine. Disturbance in gut microbiota composition can 
      alter the central nervous system and enteric nervous system functions. 
      Metagenomics has been employed for the identification, and characterization of 
      gut microbes and microbial-derived metabolites. This review is focused on the gut 
      microbes-brain relationship and the role of gut microbes in neurodegenerative 
      diseases. This study is also focused on major metagenomic approaches and their 
      role in gut microbes characterization.

TI  - Aquaculture industry prospective from gut microbiome of fish and shellfish: An 
      overview.
PG  - 441-469

AB  - The microbiome actually deals with micro-organisms that are associated with 
      indigenous body parts and the entire gut system in all animals, including human 
      beings. These microbes are linked with roles involving hereditary traits, defence 
      against diseases and strengthening overall immunity, which determines the health 
      status of an organism. Considerable efforts have been made to find out the 
      microbiome diversity and their taxonomic identification in finfish and shellfish 
      and its importance has been correlated with various physiological functions and 
      activities. In recent past due to the availability of advanced molecular tools, 
      some efforts have also been made on DNA sequencing of these microbes to 
      understand the environmental impact and other stress factors on their genomic 
      structural profile. There are reports on the use of next-generation sequencing 
      (NGS) technology, including amplicon and shot-gun approaches, and associated 
      bioinformatics tools to count and classify commensal microbiome at the species 
      level. The microbiome present in the whole body, particularly in the gut systems 
      of finfish and shellfish, not only contributes to digestion but also has an 
      impact on nutrition, growth, reproduction, immune system and vulnerability of the 
      host fish to diseases. Therefore, the study of such microbial communities is 
      highly relevant for the development of new and innovative bio-products which will 
      be a vital source to build bio and pharmaceutical industries, including 
      aquaculture. In recent years, attempts have been made to discover the chemical 
      ingredients present in these microbes in the form of biomolecules/bioactive 
      compounds with their functions and usefulness for various health benefits, 
      particularly for the treatment of different types of disorders in animals. 
      Therefore, it has been speculated that microbiomes hold great promise not only as 
      a cure for ailments but also as a preventive measure for the number of infectious 
      diseases. This kind of exploration of new breeds of microbes with their 
      miraculous ingredients will definitely help to accelerate the development of the 
      drugs, pharmaceutical and other biological related industries. Probiotic research 
      and bioinformatics skills will further escalate these opportunities in the 
      sector. In the present review, efforts have been made to collect comprehensive 
      information on the finfish and shellfish microbiome, their diversity and 
      functional properties, relationship with diseases, health status, data on 
      species-specific metagenomics, probiotic research and bioinformatics skills. 
      Further, emphasis has also been made to carry out microbiome research on priority 
      basis not only to keep healthy environment of the fish farming sector but also 
      for the sustainable growth of biological related industries, including 
      aquaculture.

      The largest population of microorganisms on the human body resides in the 
      gastrointestinal tract; thus, it is not surprising that the most investigated 
      human microbiome is the human gut microbiome. On average, the gut hosts microbes 
      from more than 60 genera and contains more cells than the human body. The human 
      gut microbiome has been shown to influence many aspects of host health, including 
      more recently the brain.Several modes of interaction between the gut and the 
      brain have been discovered, including via the synthesis of metabolites and 
      neurotransmitters, activation of the vagus nerve, and activation of the immune 
      system. A growing body of work is implicating the microbiome in a variety of 
      psychological processes and neuropsychiatric disorders. These include mood and 
      anxiety disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder 
      and schizophrenia, and even neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and 
      Parkinson's diseases. Moreover, it is probable that most psychotropic medications 
      have an impact on the microbiome.Here, an overview will be provided for the 
      bidirectional role of the microbiome in brain health, age-associated cognitive 
      decline, and neurological and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, a primer on the 
      common microbiological and bioinformatics techniques used to interrogate the 
      microbiome will be provided. This review is meant to equip the reader with a 
      primer to this exciting research area that is permeating all areas of biological 
      psychiatry research.

AB  - The microbiome, which refers to the microbiota within a host and their collective 
      genomes, has recently been demonstrated to play a critical role in cancer 
      progression, metastasis, and therapeutic response. The microbiome is known to 
      affect host immunity, but its influence on human papilloma virus (HPV) 
      gynecologic malignancies remains limited and poorly understood. To date, studies 
      have largely focused on the cervicovaginal microbiome; however, there is growing 
      evidence that the gut microbiome may interact and substantially affect 
      therapeutic response in gynecologic cancers. Importantly, new developments in 
      microbiome sequencing and advanced bioinformatics technologies have enabled rapid 
      advances in our understanding of the gut and local tumor microbiota. In this 
      review, we examine the evidence supporting the role of the microbiome in 
      HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer, 
      explore characteristics that influence and shape the host microbiota that impact 
      HPV-driven carcinogenesis, and highlight potential approaches and considerations 
      for future and ongoing research of the microbiome's effect on HPV-associated 
      cancer.

      Experimental Hypertension.
PG  - 1279-1293
LID - 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.119.13079 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension is a complex and modifiable condition in which environmental factors 
      contribute to both onset and progression. Recent evidence has accumulated for 
      roles of diet and the gut microbiome as environmental factors in blood pressure 
      regulation. However, this is complex because gut microbiomes are a unique feature 
      of each individual reflecting that individual's developmental and environmental 
      history creating caveats for both experimental models and human studies. Here, we 
      describe guidelines for conducting gut microbiome studies in experimental and 
      clinical hypertension. We provide a complete guide for authors on proper design, 
      analyses, and reporting of gut microbiota/microbiome and metabolite studies and 
      checklists that can be used by reviewers and editors to support robust reporting 
      and interpretation. We discuss factors that modulate the gut microbiota in animal 
      (eg, cohort, controls, diet, developmental age, housing, sex, and models used) 
      and human studies (eg, blood pressure measurement and medication, body mass 
      index, demographic characteristics including age, cultural identification, living 
      structure, sex and socioeconomic environment, and exclusion criteria). We also 
      provide best practice advice on sampling, storage of fecal/cecal samples, DNA 
      extraction, sequencing methods (including metagenomics and 16S rRNA), and 
      computational analyses. Finally, we discuss the measurement of short-chain fatty 
      acids, metabolites produced by the gut microbiota, and interpretation of data. 
      These guidelines should support better transparency, reproducibility, and 
      translation of findings in the field of gut microbiota/microbiome in hypertension 
      and cardiovascular disease.

TI  - Over-feeding the gut microbiome: A scoping review on health implications and 
      therapeutic perspectives.
PG  - 7041-7064
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v27.i41.7041 [doi]
AB  - The human gut microbiome has gained increasing attention over the past two 
      decades. Several findings have shown that this complex and dynamic microbial 
      ecosystem can contribute to the maintenance of host health or, when subject to 
      imbalances, to the pathogenesis of various enteric and non-enteric diseases. This 
      scoping review summarizes the current knowledge on how the gut microbiota and 
      microbially-derived compounds affect host metabolism, especially in the context 
      of obesity and related disorders. Examples of microbiome-based targeted 
      intervention strategies that aim to restore and maintain an eubiotic layout are 
      then discussed. Adjuvant therapeutic interventions to alleviate obesity and 
      associated comorbidities are traditionally based on diet modulation and the 
      supplementation of prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics. However, these 
      approaches have shown only moderate ability to induce sustained changes in the 
      gut microbial ecosystem, making the development of innovative and tailored 
      microbiome-based intervention strategies of utmost importance in clinical 
      practice. In this regard, the administration of next-generation probiotics and 
      engineered microbiomes has shown promising results, together with more radical 
      intervention strategies based on the replacement of the dysbiotic ecosystem by 
      means of fecal microbiota transplantation from healthy donors or with the 
      introduction of synthetic communities specifically designed to achieve the 
      desired therapeutic outcome. Finally, we provide a perspective for future 
      translational investigations through the implementation of bioinformatics 
      approaches, including machine and deep learning, to predict health risks and 
      therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - Over the last decade, it has become increasingly apparent that the microbiome is 
      a central component in human well-being and illness. However, to establish 
      innovative therapeutic methods, it is crucial to learn more about the microbiota. 
      Thereby, the area of metagenomics and associated bioinformatics methods and tools 
      has become considerable in the study of the human microbiome biodiversity. The 
      application of these metagenomics approaches to studying the gut microbiome in 
      COVID-19 patients could be one of the promising areas of research in the fight 
      against the SARS-CoV-2 infection and disparity. Therefore, understanding how the 
      gut microbiome is affected by or could affect the SARS-CoV-2 is very important. 
      Herein, we present an overview of approaches and methods used in the current 
      published studies on COVID-19 patients and the gut microbiome. The accuracy of 
      these researches depends on the appropriate choice and the optimal use of the 
      metagenomics bioinformatics platforms and tools. Interestingly, most studies 
      reported that COVID-19 patients' microbiota are enriched with opportunistic 
      microorganisms. The choice and use of appropriate computational tools and 
      techniques to accurately investigate the gut microbiota is therefore critical in 
      determining the appropriate microbiome profile for diagnosis and the most 
      reliable antiviral or preventive microbial composition.

AB  - Advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics have greatly enhanced our 
      ability to understand the human microbiome. Over the last decade, a growing body 
      of literature has linked nutrition and the environment to the microbiome and is 
      now thought to be an important contributor to overall health. This paper reviews 
      the literature from the past 10 years to highlight the influence of environmental 
      factors such as diet, early life adversity and stress in shaping and modifying 
      our microbiome towards health and disease. The review shows that many factors 
      such as the mode of delivery, breast milk, stress, diet and medications can 
      greatly influence the development of our gut microbiome and potentially make us 
      more prone to certain diseases. By incorporating environmental factors into 
      models that study the microbiome in the setting of health and disease, may 
      provide a better understanding of disease and potentially new areas of treatment. 
      To highlight this, we will additionally explore the role of the environment and 
      the microbiome in the development of obesity and functional bowel disorders.

TI  - The human gut microbiome: a review of the effect of obesity and surgically 
      induced weight loss.
PG  - 563-9
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2013.5 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in parallel genomic processing and computational mapping have 
      been applied to the native human microbial environment to provide a new 
      understanding of the role of the microbiome in health and disease. In particular, 
      studies of the distal gut microbiome have proposed that changes in gut microbiota 
      are related to obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and Western diet. We examined the 
      changes in the distal gut microbiome composition as it relates to the lean and 
      obese phenotypes, particularly after surgical weight loss. A PubMed search of 
      publications from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2012, used the search 
      terms weight, obesity, microbiome, and bariatric surgery. We included studies 
      that provided information on subjects' weight and/or body mass index and a formal 
      assessment of the microbiome. Certain bacteria, specifically the archaeon 
      Methanobrevibacter smithii, have enhanced ability to metabolize dietary 
      substrate, thereby increasing host energy intake and weight gain. With weight 
      loss, there is a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes phyla. One 
      major finding from microbial sequencing analyses after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
      is the comparative overabundance of Proteobacteria in the distal gut microbiome, 
      which is distinct from the changes seen in weight loss without Roux-en-Y gastric 
      bypass. This review provides the practicing surgeon with (1) an update on the 
      state of a rapidly innovating branch of clinical bioinformatics, specifically, 
      the microbiome; (2) a new understanding of the microbiome changes after Roux-en-Y 
      gastric bypass and weight loss; and (3) a basis for understanding further 
      clinical applications of studies of the distal gut microbiome, such as in Crohn 
      disease, ulcerative colitis, and infectious colitis.

AB  - Recent advances in culture-free methods of studying the human microbiome, coupled 
      with strong bioinformatics tools, have provided new insights on the role of the 
      human microbiome in health and disease. The human gut, in particular, houses a 
      vast number and diverse variety of microbes. A plethora of evidence has 
      demonstrated the significant effects of the gut microbiome on local and systemic 
      immunity. Studies in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients provided 
      early evidence of the involvement of the gut microbiome in the development of 
      graft-versus-host disease and its related mortality. Cancer immunotherapy and 
      checkpoint inhibitors, in particular, harness the power of the host's immune 
      system to fight a range of malignancies. Resistance to immunotherapy and fatal 
      immune-related adverse events both continue to be challenges in the field. The 
      role of the human gut microbiome in affecting the response to immunotherapy was 
      recently uncovered through a series of preclinical and clinical studies. The 
      evidence presented in these studies provides tremendous potential for gut 
      microbes to be used for biomarker development and therapeutic intervention 
      trials.

AB  - The scientific community currently defines the human microbiome as all the 
      bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and eukaryotes that occupy the human body. 
      When considering the variable locations, composition, diversity, and abundance of 
      our microbial symbionts, the sheer volume of microorganisms reaches hundreds of 
      trillions. With the onset of next generation sequencing (NGS), also known as 
      high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies, the barriers to studying the human 
      microbiome lowered significantly, making in-depth microbiome research accessible. 
      Certain locations on the human body, such as the gastrointestinal, oral, nasal, 
      and skin microbiomes have been heavily studied through community-focused projects 
      like the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). In particular, the gastrointestinal 
      microbiome (GM) has received significant attention due to links to neurological, 
      immunological, and metabolic diseases, as well as cancer. Though HTS technologies 
      allow deeper exploration of the GM, data informing the functional characteristics 
      of microbiota and resulting effects on human function or disease are still 
      sparse. This void is compounded by microbiome variability observed among humans 
      through factors like genetics, environment, diet, metabolic activity, and even 
      exercise; making GM research inherently difficult to study. This chapter 
      describes an interdisciplinary approach to GM research with the goal of 
      mitigating the hindrances of translating findings into a clinical setting. By 
      applying tools and knowledge from microbiology, metagenomics, bioinformatics, 
      machine learning, predictive modeling, and clinical study data from children with 
      treatment-resistant epilepsy, we describe a proof-of-concept approach to clinical 
      translation and precision application of GM research.

AB  - Prevotella copri is an abundant member of the human gastrointestinal microbiome, 
      whose relative abundance has curiously been associated with positive and negative 
      impacts on diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Yet, 
      the verdict is still out on the definitive role of P. copri in human health, and 
      on the effect of different diets on its relative abundance in the gut microbiome. 
      The puzzling discrepancies among P. copri studies have only recently been 
      attributed to the diversity of its strains, which substantially differ in their 
      encoded metabolic patterns from the commonly used reference strain. However, such 
      strain differences cannot be resolved by common 16S rRNA amplicon profiling 
      methods. Here, we scrutinize P. copri, its versatile metabolic potential, and the 
      hypotheses behind the conflicting observations on its association with diet and 
      human health. We also provide suggestions for designing studies and 
      bioinformatics pipelines to better research P. copri.

PG  - 6594-6598
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00962 [doi]
AB  - Lysine acylations are important post-translational modifications that are present 
      in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and regulate diverse cellular functions. Our 
      knowledge of the microbiome lysine acylation remains limited due to the lack of 
      efficient analytical and bioinformatics methods for complex microbial 
      communities. Here, we show that the serial enrichment using motif antibodies 
      successfully captures peptides containing lysine acetylation, propionylation, and 
      succinylation from human gut microbiome samples. A new bioinformatic workflow 
      consisting of an unrestricted database search confidently identified >60,000 
      acetylated, and ∼20,000 propionylated and succinylated gut microbial peptides. 
      The characterization of these identified modification-specific metaproteomes, 
      i.e., meta-PTMomes, demonstrates that lysine acylations are differentially 
      distributed in microbial species with different metabolic capabilities. This 
      study provides an analytical framework for the study of lysine acylations in the 
      microbiome, which enables functional microbiome studies at the post-translational 
      level.

AB  - Descriptions of the microbial communities that live on and in the human body have 
      progressed at a spectacular rate over the past 5 years, fuelled primarily by 
      highly parallel DNA-sequencing technologies and associated advances in 
      bioinformatics, and by the expectation that understanding how to manipulate the 
      structure and functions of our microbiota will allow us to affect health and 
      prevent or treat diseases. Among the myriad of genes that have been identified in 
      the human gut microbiome, those that encode carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) 
      are of particular interest, as these enzymes are required to digest most of our 
      complex repertoire of dietary polysaccharides. In this Analysis article, we 
      examine the carbohydrate-digestive capacity of a simplified but representative 
      mini-microbiome in order to highlight the abundance and variety of bacterial 
      CAZymes that are represented in the human gut microbiota.

TI  - Implications of gut microbiome on coronary artery disease.
PG  - 869-880
LID - 10.21037/cdt-20-428 [doi]
AB  - Despite the enormous progress achieved in diagnosis and medical therapy of 
      coronary artery disease (CAD) in the last decades, CAD continues to represent the 
      leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, leading to a massive 
      health-care cost and social burden. Due to the dynamic and complex nature of CAD, 
      the mechanisms underlying the progression of atherosclerotic plaque were largely 
      unknown. With the development of metagenomics and bioinformatics, humans are 
      gradually understanding the important role of the gut microbiome on their hosts. 
      Trillions of microbes colonize in the human gut, they digest and absorb 
      nutrients, as well as participate in a series of human functions and regulate the 
      pathogenesis of diseases, including the cardiovascular disease (CVD) that has 
      received much attention. Meanwhile, metabolomics studies have revealed 
      associations between gut microbiota-derived metabolic bioactive signaling 
      modules, including trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), short-chain fatty acids 
      (SCFAs), and bile acids (BAs), with the progression of CAD. Disturbance of the 
      gut microbiome and microbial metabolites are important factors leading to CAD, 
      which has become a novel target for CAD prevention and treatment. This review 
      provides a brief overview of gut microbiome composition in CAD patients according 
      to the recently reported studies, summarizes the underlying mechanisms, and 
      highlights the prognostic value of the gut microbiome in CAD.

AB  - The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that both affects and is affected 
      by its host status. Previous metagenomic analyses of gut microflora revealed 
      associations between specific microbes and host age. Nonetheless there was no 
      reliable way to tell a host's age based on the gut community composition. Here we 
      developed a method of predicting hosts' age based on microflora taxonomic 
      profiles using a cross-study dataset and deep learning. Our best model has an 
      architecture of a deep neural network that achieves the mean absolute error of 
      5.91 years when tested on external data. We further advance a procedure for 
      inferring the role of particular microbes during human aging and defining them as 
      potential aging biomarkers. The described intestinal clock represents a unique 
      quantitative model of gut microflora aging and provides a starting point for 
      building host aging and gut community succession into a single narrative.

TI  - Alterations of the Human Gut Microbiome in Patients With Hidradenitis

PG  - e2022191
LID - 10.5826/dpc.1204a191 [doi]
LID - e2022191
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and systemic 
      inflammatory disease that extends beyond the skin. The role of gut microbiome 
      (GM) alterations in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders is 
      remarkable. OBJECTIVES: Based on the hypothesis that dysbiosis in the GM may 
      trigger systemic inflammation in the pathogenesis of HS, this study aimed to 
      investigate whether the GM is altered in HS patients compared with healthy 
      subjects. METHODS: In the present case-control study, fecal samples from 15 
      patients with HS and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were collected 
      and analyzed using 16S rRNA-based metagenomic analysis, New Generation Sequencing 
      (NGS). The V3 and V4-hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rDNA gene were 
      amplified from all samples and sequenced by the Illumina MiSeq platform. 
      Bioinformatics analyses were performed in QIIME2. RESULTS: Shannon alpha 
      diversity index showed significantly reduced diversity in HS patients (P = 
      0.048). Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity and Jaccard Distance revealed that the gut 
      microbial composition of HS patients was significantly distinctive from that of 
      controls (P = 0.01 and P = 0.007, respectively). The relative abundance of 
      unclassified Clostridiales, unclassified Firmicutes, and Fusicatenibacter in HS 
      was significantly lower than that in controls (P = 0.005, P = 0.029, and P = 
      0.046, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that significant 
      alterations in the GM of HS patients could play a critical role in the 
      pathogenesis of HS and might be a trigger for systemic inflammation. Increased 
      understanding of the pathogenesis of HS will shed light on the new potential 
      therapeutic targets and novel treatment options.

AB  - The human gut is colonized by a wide diversity of micro-organisms, which are now 
      known to play a key role in the human host by regulating metabolic functions and 
      immune homeostasis. Many studies have indicated that the genomes of our gut 
      microbiota, known as the gut microbiome or our "other genome" could play an 
      important role in immune-related, complex diseases, and growing evidence supports 
      a causal role for gut microbiota in regulating predisposition to diseases. A 
      comprehensive analysis of the human gut microbiome is thus important to unravel 
      the exact mechanisms by which the gut microbiota are involved in health and 
      disease. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology, along with the 
      development of metagenomics and bioinformatics tools, have provided opportunities 
      to characterize the microbial communities. Furthermore, studies using germ-free 
      animals have shed light on how the gut microbiota are involved in autoimmunity. 
      In this review we describe the different approaches used to characterize the 
      human microbiome, review current knowledge about the gut microbiome, and discuss 
      the role of gut microbiota in immune homeostasis and autoimmunity. Finally, we 
      indicate how this knowledge could be used to improve human health by manipulating 
      the gut microbiota. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: From Genome 
      to Function.

AB  - Bacteriophages (phages) have been known for over a century, but only in the last 
      2 decades have we really come to appreciate how abundant and diverse they are. 
      With that realization, research groups across the globe have shown the importance 
      of phage-based processes in a myriad of environments, including the global oceans 
      and soils, and as part of the human microbiome. Through advances in sequencing 
      technology, genomics, and bioinformatics, we know that the morphological 
      diversity of bacteriophages originally used for taxonomy is eclipsed by their 
      genomic diversity. Because we currently do not have a complete taxonomic 
      framework or naming scheme to describe this diversity, crucial information from 
      virome and microbiome studies is being lost. In this commentary, I will discuss 
      recent advances in taxonomy and its importance for studies of the microbiome with 
      examples of the human gut phageome and make recommendations for future analyses.

TI  - Computational approach to modeling microbiome landscapes associated with chronic 
      human disease progression.
PG  - e1010373

LID - e1010373
AB  - A microbial community is a dynamic system undergoing constant change in response 
      to internal and external stimuli. These changes can have significant implications 
      for human health. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining longitudinal 
      samples, the study of the dynamic relationship between the microbiome and human 
      health remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a novel computational strategy 
      that uses massive cross-sectional sample data to model microbiome landscapes 
      associated with chronic disease development. The strategy is based on the 
      rationale that each static sample provides a snapshot of the disease process, and 
      if the number of samples is sufficiently large, the footprints of individual 
      samples populate progression trajectories, which enables us to recover disease 
      progression paths along a microbiome landscape by using computational approaches. 
      To demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy, we developed a 
      bioinformatics pipeline and applied it to a gut microbiome dataset available from 
      a Crohn's disease study. Our analysis resulted in one of the first working models 
      of microbial progression for Crohn's disease. We performed a series of 
      interrogations to validate the constructed model. Our analysis suggested that the 
      model recapitulated the longitudinal progression of microbial dysbiosis during 
      the known clinical trajectory of Crohn's disease. By overcoming restrictions 
      associated with complex longitudinal sampling, the proposed strategy can provide 
      valuable insights into the role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of chronic 
      disease and facilitate the shift of the field from descriptive research to 
      mechanistic studies.

AB  - Human gut microbiome analysis through faecal sampling typically involves five 
      stages: sample collection, storage, DNA extraction, next generation sequencing 
      and bioinformatics analysis. Of these, the first three are considered 
      irreversible. This feasibility study describes an assessment of methodologies 
      used for faecal DNA extraction and sample handling, using the parameters DNA 
      yield, purity and resultant microbial profile. Six DNA extraction techniques, 
      including commercially available kits and manual protocols were compared on human 
      faecal samples (n = 3). Different extraction techniques produced significant 
      variance in DNA yield (range 2.7-164 ng/mg faeces) and microbial diversity 
      profiles, with considerable variation in phyla dominance (Firmicutes (P < 0.001), 
      Bacteroidetes (P = 0.003), Actinobacteria (P = 0.003), One-way ANOVA). The most 
      effective method, with the highest DNA yield, was a simple and inexpensive 
      extraction technique named MetaHIT. Using this method, DNA was extracted from 
      separate faecal samples (n = 3) and had been aliquoted to seven storage 
      conditions including three stabilizing buffers and three temperature conditions, 
      for a period of 120-h, with storage at -80 °C as a control treatment. DNA yield 
      and purity was not statistically different between the control and remaining 
      treatments. 16S rDNA-based diversity profile was largely comparable across the 
      treatments with only minor differences in genera between samples stored at room 
      temperature in air and - 80 °C control. Overall these results suggest that the 
      choice of DNA extraction method has a greater influence on the resultant 
      microbial diversity profile than the short-term storage method.

TI  - Relationship between Nutrient Intake and Human Gut Microbiota in Monozygotic 
      Twins.
LID - 10.3390/medicina57030275 [doi]
LID - 275
AB  - Background and Objectives: The gut microbiota is associated with human health and 
      dietary nutrition. Various studies have been reported in this regard, but it is 
      difficult to clearly analyze human gut microbiota as individual differences are 
      significant. The causes of these individual differences in intestinal microflora 
      are genetic and/or environmental. In this study, we focused on differences 
      between identical twins in Japan to clarify the effects of nutrients consumed on 
      the entire gut microbiome, while excluding genetic differences. Materials and 
      Methods: We selected healthy Japanese monozygotic twins for the study and 
      confirmed their zygosity by matching 15 short tandem repeat loci. Their fecal 
      samples were subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses to 
      identify and compare the fluctuations in intestinal bacteria. Results: We 
      identified 12 genera sensitive to environmental factors, and found that 
      Lactobacillus was relatively unaffected by environmental factors. Moreover, we 
      identified protein, fat, and some nutrient intake that can affect 12 genera, 
      which have been identified to be more sensitive to environmental factors. Among 
      the 12 genera, Bacteroides had a positive correlation with retinol equivalent 
      intake (rs = 0.38), Lachnospira had a significantly negative correlation with 
      protein, sodium, iron, vitamin D, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 intake (rs = -0.38, 
      -0.41, -0.39, -0.63, -0.42, -0.49, respectively), Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group 
      had a positive correlation with fat intake (rs = 0.39), and Lachnospiraceae 
      UCG-008 group had a negative correlation with the saturated fatty acid intake (rs 
      = -0.45). Conclusions: Our study is the first to focus on the relationship 
      between human gut microbiota and nutrient intake using samples from Japanese 
      twins to exclude the effects of genetic factors. These findings will broaden our 
      understanding of the more intuitive relationship between nutrient intake and the 
      gut microbiota and can be a useful basis for finding useful biomarkers that 
      contribute to human health.

AB  - PURPOSE: The development of next-generation sequencing and accompanying 
      bioinformatics tools has revolutionized characterization of microbial 
      communities. As interest grows in the role of the human microbiome in health and 
      disease, so does the need for well-powered, robustly designed epidemiologic 
      studies. Here, we discuss sources of bias that can arise in gut microbiome 
      research. METHODS: Research comparing methods of specimen collection, 
      preservation, processing, and analysis of gut microbiome samples is reviewed. 
      Although selected studies are primarily based on the gut, many of the same 
      principles are applicable to samples derived from other anatomical sites. Methods 
      for participant recruitment and sampling of the gut microbiome implemented in an 
      ongoing population-based study, the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), are also described. 
      RESULTS: Variation in methodologies can influence the results of human microbiome 
      studies. To help minimize bias, techniques such as sample homogenization, 
      addition of internal standards, and quality filtering should be adopted in 
      protocols. Within the MEC, participant response rates to stool sample collection 
      were comparable to other studies, and in-home stool sample collection yields 
      sufficient high-quality DNA for gut microbiome analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Application 
      of standardized and quality controlled methods in human microbiome studies is 
      necessary to ensure data quality and comparability among studies.

AB  - Research examining the gut microbiota is currently exploding, and results are 
      providing new perspectives on human biology. Factors such as host diet and 
      physiology influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota, which in 
      turn affects human nutrition, health, and behavior via interactions with 
      metabolism, the immune system, and the brain. These findings represent an 
      exciting new twist on familiar topics, and as a result, gut microbiome research 
      is likely to provide insight into unresolved biological mechanisms driving human 
      health. However, much remains to be learned about the broader ecological and 
      evolutionary contexts within which gut microbes and humans are affecting each 
      other. Here, I outline the procedures for generating data describing the gut 
      microbiota with the goal of facilitating the wider integration of microbiome 
      analyses into studies of human biology. I describe the steps involved in sample 
      collection, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, high-throughput sequencing, and 
      bioinformatics. While this review serves only as an introduction to these topics, 
      it provides sufficient resources for researchers interested in launching new 
      microbiome initiatives. As knowledge of these methods spreads, microbiome 
      analysis should become a standard tool in the arsenal of human biology research.

AB  - Microbiome studies estimate the functions of bacterial flora in situ on the basis 
      of species composition and gene function; however, estimation of interspecies 
      interaction networks is challenging. This study aimed to develop a method to 
      predict the interaction networks among bacterial species from human gut 
      metagenome data using bioinformatics methods. Our proposed method revealed that 
      adjacent gene pairs involved in bacterial interspecies interactions are localized 
      at boundary regions and encode membrane proteins mediating interactions between 
      the intracellular and extracellular environments, e.g., transporters and channel 
      proteins, and those mediating interactions between metabolic pathways. Actual 
      human gut metagenome data displayed numerous such highly reliable interspecies 
      interaction gene pairs in comparison with random simulated metagenome data sets, 
      suggesting that the species composition of the actual microbiome facilitated more 
      robust interspecific interactions. The present results indicate that molecular 
      interaction networks in human gut flora are organized by a combination of 
      interaction networks common to all individuals and group-specific interaction 
      networks.

      pylori-Associated Diseases.
PG  - 337-48
LID - 10.1111/hel.12297 [doi]
AB  - The development of new nucleotide sequencing techniques and advanced 
      bioinformatics tools has opened the field for studying the diversity and 
      complexity of the gastrointestinal microbiome independent of traditional cultural 
      methods. Owing largely to the gastric acid barrier, the human stomach was long 
      thought to be sterile. The discovery of Helicobacter pylori, the gram-negative 
      bacterium that infects upwards of 50% of the global population, has started a 
      major paradigm shift in our understanding of the stomach as an ecologic niche for 
      bacteria. Recent sequencing analysis of gastric microbiota showed that H. pylori 
      was not alone and the interaction of H. pylori with those microorganisms might 
      play a part in H. pylori-associated diseases such as gastric cancer. In this 
      review, we summarize the available literature about the changes of 
      gastrointestinal microbiota after H. pylori infection in humans and animal 
      models, and discuss the possible underlying mechanisms including the alterations 
      of the gastric environment, the secretion of hormones and the degree of 
      inflammatory response. In general, information regarding the composition and 
      function of gastrointestinal microbiome is still in its infancy, future studies 
      are needed to elucidate whether and to what extent H. pylori infection perturbs 
      the established microbiota. It is assumed that clarifying the role of 
      gastrointestinal communities in H. pylori-associated diseases will provide an 
      opportunity for translational application as a biomarker for the risk of serious 
      H. pylori diseases and perhaps identify specific organisms for therapeutic 
      eradication.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To present and evaluate the recent findings that contribute to 
      our understanding of the functional impact of diet on the enteric microbiome and 
      outcomes of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Nutrients in excess and in deficiency have 
      significant impact on gut microbial communities in both rodents and humans, 
      acting directly on the microbiota or indirectly via altering host physiology. 
      Furthermore, the effects of diet on the microbiome in determining health or 
      disease can differ substantially depending on the age and environment of the 
      individual. SUMMARY: Dietary compounds can have profound short-term and long-term 
      effects on the assemblage of the gut microbiome, which in turn affects the 
      host-microbe interactions critically important for intestinal, metabolic, and 
      immune homeostasis. Until recently, the mechanisms underlying these effects were 
      poorly understood. However, new insights have now been gained, made possible 
      through the application of advanced technologies and bioinformatics, novel 
      experimental models, and human research. As a result, our conceptual framework 
      for understanding the impact of diet on the gut microbiome, health, and disease 
      has advanced considerably, bringing the promise of better tools of risk 
      assessment, diagnostics, and therapeutic intervention in an age of personalized 
      medicine.

AB  - The "Landscape Of Gut Microbiome - Pan-India Exploration", or LogMPIE study, is 
      the first large-scale, nationwide record of the Indian gut microbiome. The 
      primary objective of the study was to identify and map the Indian gut microbiome 
      baseline. This observational study was conducted across 14 geographical locations 
      in India. Enrolled subjects were uniformly distributed across geographies (north, 
      east, west and south) and body mass index (obese and non-obese). Furthermore, 
      factors influencing the microbiome, such as age and physical activity, were also 
      considered in the study design. The LogMPIE study recorded data from 1004 
      eligible subjects and reported 993 unique microorganisms across the Indian 
      microbiome diaspora. The data not only map the Indian gut microbiome baseline but 
      also function as a useful resource to study, analyse and identify signatures 
      characterizing the physiological dispositions of the subjects. Furthermore, they 
      provide insight into the unique features describing the Indian microbiome. The 
      data are open and may be accessed from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) 
      portal of the European Bioinformatics Institute 
      (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB25642).

AB  - Microbiomes convoy human life in countless ways. They are an essential part of 
      the human body and interact with its host in countless ways. Currently, extensive 
      microbiome analyses assessing the microbiomes' composition and functions based on 
      sequencing information are still far away from being routine analyses due to the 
      complexity of applied techniques and data analysis, their time demand as well as 
      high costs. With the growing demand for on-time community assessment and 
      monitoring of its dynamic behavior with high resolution, alternative 
      high-throughput methods such as microbial community flow cytometry come into 
      focus. Our flow cytometric approach provides single-cell based high-dimensional 
      data by using only three parameters but for every cell in a system which is 
      enough to characterize whole communities' attributes with high acuity over time. 
      To interpret such complex cytometric time-series data, novel concepts are 
      required. We provide a workflow which is applicable for easy-to-use handling and 
      measurement of microbiomes. Drawing inspiration from macro-ecology, in which a 
      rich set of concepts has been developed for describing population dynamics, we 
      interpret huge sets of community single cell data in an intuitive and actionable 
      way using a series of bioinformatics tools which we either developed or adapted 
      from sequence based evaluation approaches for the interpretation of single cell 
      data. The developed evaluation pipeline tests for e.g. ecological measures such 
      as community assembly, functioning, and evolution. We also addressed the 
      meta-community-concept which is a well acknowledged idea in macro-ecology on how 
      interconnected communities perform. The last concept discusses stability which is 
      a metrics of paramount importance. A fast quantification of stability properties 
      may not only detect disturbances and their impact on the organisms but also allow 
      for on-time microbiome treatment. The workflow's immanent ability to support high 
      temporal sample densities below bacterial generation times provides new insight 
      into the ecology of microbiomes and may also provide access to community control 
      for microbiome based health management. The future developments will facilitate 
      cytometric fingerprinting for human routine diagnostics to be as simple and 
      meaningful as a blood count today.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is a major public health problem, accounting for high 
      rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The cirrhosis etiology is a broad and 
      essential step in planning a treatment strategy. Many recent studies have 
      documented that gut microbiome alterations play a vital role in the development 
      and progression of cirrhosis and its complications. Nevertheless, there is 
      insufficient data on the correlation between liver cirrhosis and gut phageome 
      alterations in patients with advanced liver diseases. This study aimed to analyze 
      the taxonomic structure and functional attributes of the gut phageome in six 
      different etiologies of advanced liver cirrhosis. METHODS: We first retrieved 
      metagenomic sequencing data from three datasets of fecal samples taken from 
      cirrhotic patients with various etiologies. Subsequently, several bioinformatics 
      pipelines were used to analyze bacteriophage composition and determine their 
      functionality. RESULTS: A gene catalog of 479,425 non-redundant genes was 
      developed as a reference to measure gene prevalence. The results of the analysis 
      revealed a few significant differences among the cohorts at the phage species 
      level. However, the alternations were more evident as there were more in-depth 
      analyses of the functional resolution of the gut phageome. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggest that the functional analysis of the gut phageome would provide 
      meaningful markers to predict the progression of liver cirrhosis and facilitate 
      the development of novel treatment approaches.

TI  - Intermittent Hypoxia and Hypercapnia Alter Diurnal Rhythms of Luminal Gut 
      Microbiome and Metabolome.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by intermittent hypoxia and 
      hypercapnia (IHC), affects the composition of the gut microbiome and metabolome. 
      The gut microbiome has diurnal oscillations that play a crucial role in 
      regulating circadian and overall metabolic homeostasis. Thus, we hypothesized 
      that IHC adversely alters the gut luminal dynamics of key microbial families and 
      metabolites. The objective of this study was to determine the diurnal dynamics of 
      the fecal microbiome and metabolome of Apoe(-/-) mice after a week of IHC 
      exposure. Individually housed, 10-week-old Apoe(-/-) mice on an atherogenic diet 
      were split into two groups. One group was exposed to daily IHC conditions for 
      10 h (Zeitgeber time 2 [ZT2] to ZT12), while the other was maintained in room 
      air. Six days after the initiation of the IHC conditions, fecal samples were 
      collected every 4 h for 24 h (6 time points). We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon 
      sequencing and untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to 
      assess changes in the microbiome and metabolome. IHC induced global changes in 
      the cyclical dynamics of the gut microbiome and metabolome. Ruminococcaceae, 
      Lachnospiraceae, S24-7, and Verrucomicrobiaceae had the greatest shifts in their 
      diurnal oscillations. In the metabolome, bile acids, glycerolipids 
      (phosphocholines and phosphoethanolamines), and acylcarnitines were greatly 
      affected. Multi-omic analysis of these results demonstrated that Ruminococcaceae 
      and tauro-β-muricholic acid (TβMCA) cooccur and are associated with IHC 
      conditions and that Coriobacteriaceae and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) cooccur 
      and are associated with control conditions. IHC significantly change the diurnal 
      dynamics of the fecal microbiome and metabolome, increasing members and 
      metabolites that are proinflammatory and proatherogenic while decreasing 
      protective ones. IMPORTANCE People with obstructive sleep apnea are at a higher 
      risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias, stroke, and 
      sudden cardiac death. We wanted to understand whether the gut microbiome changes 
      induced by obstructive sleep apnea could potentially explain some of these 
      medical problems. By collecting stool from a mouse model of this disease at 
      multiple time points during the day, we studied how obstructive sleep apnea 
      changed the day-night patterns of microbes and metabolites of the gut. Since the 
      oscillations of the gut microbiome play a crucial role in regulating metabolism, 
      changes in these oscillations can explain why these patients can develop so many 
      metabolic problems. We found changes in microbial families and metabolites that 
      regulate many metabolic pathways contributing to the increased risk for heart 
      disease seen in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.

AB  - Potential effects of metabiotics (probiotics effector molecules or signaling 
      factors), pharmabiotics (pro-functional metabolites produced by gut microbiota 
      (GMB)) and postbiotics (multifunctional metabolites and structural compounds of 
      food-grade microorganisms) on GMB have been rarely reviewed. These 
      multifunctional components have several promising capabilities for prevention, 
      alleviation and treatment of some diseases or disorders. Correlations between 
      these essential biotics and GMB are also very interesting and important in human 
      health and nutrition. Furthermore, these natural bioactives are involved in 
      modulation of the immune function, control of metabolic dysbiosis and regulation 
      of the signaling pathways. This review discusses the potential of 
      meta/pharma/post-biotics as new classes of pharmaceutical agents and their 
      effective mechanisms associated with GMB-host cell to cell communications with 
      therapeutic benefits which are important in balance and the integrity of the host 
      microbiome. In addition, cutting-edge findings about bioinformatics /metabolomics 
      analyses related to GMB and these essential biotics are reviewed.

AB  - The human gut holds the densest microbiome ecosystem essential in maintaining a 
      healthy host physiology, whereby disruption of this ecosystem has been linked to 
      the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). The advent of next-generation 
      sequencing technologies such as the 16S rRNA gene sequencing has enabled 
      characterization of the CRC gut microbiome architecture in an affordable and 
      culture-free approach. Nevertheless, the lack of standardization in handling and 
      storage of biospecimens, nucleic acid extraction, 16S rRNA gene primer selection, 
      length, and depth of sequencing and bioinformatics analyses have contributed to 
      discrepancies found in various published studies of this field. Accurate 
      characterization of the CRC microbiome found in different stages of CRC has the 
      potential to be developed into a screening tool in the clinical setting. This 
      mini review aims to concisely compile all available CRC microbiome studies 
      performed till end of 2016 and to suggest standardized protocols that are crucial 
      in developing a gut microbiome screening panel for CRC.

LID - 220
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high incidence of bacterial genes that confer resistance to 
      last-resort antibiotics, such as colistin, caused by mobilized colistin 
      resistance (mcr) genes, poses an unprecedented threat to human health. 
      Understanding the spread, evolution, and distribution of such genes among human 
      populations will help in the development of strategies to diminish their 
      occurrence. To tackle this problem, we investigated the distribution and 
      prevalence of potential mcr genes in the human gut microbiome using a set of 
      bioinformatics tools to screen the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) 
      collection for the presence, synteny and phylogeny of putative mcr genes, and 
      co-located antibiotic resistance genes. RESULTS: A total of 2079 antibiotic 
      resistance genes (ARGs) were classified as mcr genes in 2046 metagenome assembled 
      genomes (MAGs), distributed across 1596 individuals from 41 countries, of which 
      215 were identified in plasmidial contigs. The genera that presented the largest 
      number of mcr-like genes were Suterella and Parasuterella. Other potential 
      pathogens carrying mcr genes belonged to the genus Vibrio, Escherichia and 
      Campylobacter. Finally, we identified a total of 22,746 ARGs belonging to 21 
      different classes in the same 2046 MAGs, suggesting multi-resistance potential in 
      the corresponding bacterial strains, increasing the concern of ARGs impact in the 
      clinical settings. CONCLUSION: This study uncovers the diversity of mcr-like 
      genes in the human gut microbiome. We demonstrated the cosmopolitan distribution 
      of these genes in individuals worldwide and the co-presence of other antibiotic 
      resistance genes, including Extended-spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL). Also, we 
      described mcr-like genes fused to a PAP2-like domain in S. wadsworthensis. These 
      novel sequences increase our knowledge about the diversity and evolution of 
      mcr-like genes. Future research should focus on activity, genetic mobility and a 
      potential colistin resistance in the corresponding strains to experimentally 
      validate those findings.

AB  - Microbial organisms of the human gut microbiome do not exist in isolation but 
      form complex and diverse interactions to maintain health and reduce risk of 
      disease development. The organization of the gut microbiome is assumed to be a 
      singular assortative network, where interactions between operational taxonomic 
      units (OTUs) can readily be clustered into segregated and distinct communities. 
      Here, we leverage recent methodological advances in network modeling to assess 
      whether communities in the human microbiome exhibit a single network structure or 
      whether co-existing mesoscale network architectures are present. We found 
      evidence for core-periphery structures in the microbiome, supported by strong, 
      assortative community interactions. This complex architecture, coupled with 
      previously reported functional roles of OTUs, provides a nuanced understanding of 
      how the microbiome simultaneously promotes high microbial diversity and maintains 
      functional redundancy.

AB  - Predicting the dynamics and functions of microbiomes constructed from the 
      bottom-up is a key challenge in exploiting them to our benefit. Current models 
      based on ecological theory fail to capture complex community behaviors due to 
      higher order interactions, do not scale well with increasing complexity and in 
      considering multiple functions. We develop and apply a long short-term memory 
      (LSTM) framework to advance our understanding of community assembly and 
      health-relevant metabolite production using a synthetic human gut community. A 
      mainstay of recurrent neural networks, the LSTM learns a high dimensional 
      data-driven non-linear dynamical system model. We show that the LSTM model can 
      outperform the widely used generalized Lotka-Volterra model based on ecological 
      theory. We build methods to decipher microbe-microbe and microbe-metabolite 
      interactions from an otherwise black-box model. These methods highlight that 
      Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are significant drivers of 
      metabolite production whereas Bacteroides shape community dynamics. We use the 
      LSTM model to navigate a large multidimensional functional landscape to design 
      communities with unique health-relevant metabolite profiles and temporal 
      behaviors. In sum, the accuracy of the LSTM model can be exploited for 
      experimental planning and to guide the design of synthetic microbiomes with 
      target dynamic functions.

TI  - Mining the human gut microbiome for novel stress resistance genes.
PG  - 394-7
AB  - With the rapid advances in sequencing technologies in recent years, the human 
      genome is now considered incomplete without the complementing microbiome, which 
      outnumbers human genes by a factor of one hundred. The human microbiome, and more 
      specifically the gut microbiome, has received considerable attention and research 
      efforts over the past decade. Many studies have identified and quantified "who is 
      there?," while others have determined some of their functional capacity, or "what 
      are they doing?" In a recent study, we identified novel salt-tolerance loci from 
      the human gut microbiome using combined functional metagenomic and bioinformatics 
      based approaches. Herein, we discuss the identified loci, their role in 
      salt-tolerance and their importance in the context of the gut environment. We 
      also consider the utility and power of functional metagenomics for mining such 
      environments for novel genes and proteins, as well as the implications and 
      possible applications for future research.

AB  - The gut microbiome has a fundamental role in human health and disease. However, 
      studying the complex structure and function of the gut microbiome using next 
      generation sequencing is challenging and prone to reproducibility problems. Here, 
      we obtained cross-sectional colon biopsies and faecal samples from nine 
      participants in our COLSCREEN study and sequenced them in high coverage using 
      Illumina pair-end shotgun (for faecal samples) and IonTorrent 16S (for paired 
      feces and colon biopsies) technologies. The metagenomes consisted of between 47 
      and 92 million reads per sample and the targeted sequencing covered more than 
      300 k reads per sample across seven hypervariable regions of the 16S gene. Our 
      data is freely available and coupled with code for the presented metagenomic 
      analysis using up-to-date bioinformatics algorithms. These results will add up to 
      the informed insights into designing comprehensive microbiome analysis and also 
      provide data for further testing for unambiguous gut microbiome analysis.

      Disease: A Systematic Review.

LID - 10.3233/JPD-191711 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiota have been studied in relation to the pathophysiology of 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) due to the early gastrointestinal symptomatology and 
      presence of alpha-synuclein pathology in the enteric nervous system, hypothesized 
      to ascend via the vagal nerve to the central nervous system. Accordingly, sixteen 
      human case-control studies have published gut microbiome composition changes in 
      PD and reported over 100 differentially abundant taxa covering all taxonomic 
      levels from phylum to genus or species, depending on methodology. While certain 
      findings were replicated across several studies, various contradictory findings 
      were reported. Here, differences in methodologies and the presence of possible 
      confounders in the study populations are assessed for their potential to confound 
      the results of gut microbiome studies in PD. Gut microbiome studies in PD 
      exhibited considerable variability with respect to the study population, sample 
      transport conditions, laboratory protocols and sequencing, bioinformatics 
      pipelines, and biostatistical methods. To move from the current heterogeneous 
      dataset towards clinically relevant biomarkers and the identification of putative 
      therapeutic targets, recommendations are derived from the limitations of the 
      available studies to increase the future comparability of microbiome studies in 
      PD. In addition, integration of currently available data on the gut microbiome in 
      PD is proposed to identify robust gut microbiome profiles in PD. Furthermore, 
      expansion of the current dataset with atypical parkinsonism cohorts, prodromal 
      and treatment-naïve de novo PD subjects, measurements of fecal microbial 
      concentrations and multi-omics assessments are required to provide clinically 
      relevant biomarkers and reveal therapeutic targets within the gut microbiome of 
      PD.

AB  - The phage-bacteria interactions in the gut microbiome are critical for health and 
      disease, but viruses of the human gut microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we 
      present a simple and cost-efficient protocol for collecting viral-like particles 
      (VLPs) from human fecal samples. We describe VLPs quantification using 
      epifluorescence and TEM microscopy, followed by DNA sequencing and bioinformatics 
      analysis. This protocol characterizes the gut phageome in normal-weight and obese 
      children with metabolic syndrome. It is also suitable to conduct high-throughput 
      studies for other diseases. For complete details on the use and execution of this 
      profile, please refer to Bikel et al. (2021).

AB  - The animal and bacterial kingdoms have coevolved and coadapted in response to 
      environmental selective pressures over hundreds of millions of years. The 
      meta'omics revolution in both sequencing and its analytic pipelines is fostering 
      an explosion of interest in how the gut microbiome impacts physiology and 
      propensity to disease. Gut microbiome studies are inherently interdisciplinary, 
      drawing on approaches and technical skill sets from the biomedical sciences, 
      ecology, and computational biology. Central to unraveling the complex biology of 
      environment, genetics, and microbiome interaction in human health and disease is 
      a deeper understanding of the symbiosis between animals and bacteria. 
      Experimental model systems, including mice, fish, insects, and the Hawaiian 
      bobtail squid, continue to provide critical insight into how host-microbiota 
      homeostasis is constructed and maintained. Here we consider how model systems are 
      influencing current understanding of host-microbiota interactions and explore 
      recent human microbiome studies.

TI  - LightCUD: a program for diagnosing IBD based on human gut microbiome data.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/s13040-021-00241-2 [doi]
LID - 2
AB  - BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and discrimination 
      between the types of IBD are clinically important. IBD is associated with marked 
      changes in the intestinal microbiota. Advances in next-generation sequencing 
      (NGS) technology and the improved hospital bioinformatics analysis ability 
      motivated us to develop a diagnostic method based on the gut microbiome. RESULTS: 
      Using a set of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 349 human gut microbiota 
      samples with two types of IBD and healthy controls, we assembled and aligned WGS 
      short reads to obtain feature profiles of strains and genera. The genus and 
      strain profiles were used for the 16S-based and WGS-based diagnostic modules 
      construction respectively. We designed a novel feature selection procedure to 
      select those case-specific features. With these features, we built discrimination 
      models using different machine learning algorithms. The machine learning 
      algorithm LightGBM outperformed other algorithms in this study and thus was 
      chosen as the core algorithm. Specially, we identified two small sets of 
      biomarkers (strains) separately for the WGS-based health vs IBD module and 
      ulcerative colitis vs Crohn's disease module, which contributed to the 
      optimization of model performance during pre-training. We released LightCUD as an 
      IBD diagnostic program built with LightGBM. The high performance has been 
      validated through five-fold cross-validation and using an independent test data 
      set. LightCUD was implemented in Python and packaged free for installation with 
      customized databases. With WGS data or 16S rRNA sequencing data of gut microbiome 
      samples as the input, LightCUD can discriminate IBD from healthy controls with 
      high accuracy and further identify the specific type of IBD. The executable 
      program LightCUD was released in open source with instructions at the webpage 
      http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/ZhuLab/LightCUD/ . The identified strain biomarkers could 
      be used to study the critical factors for disease development and recommend 
      treatments regarding changes in the gut microbial community. CONCLUSIONS: As the 
      first released human gut microbiome-based IBD diagnostic tool, LightCUD 
      demonstrates a high-performance for both WGS and 16S sequencing data. The strains 
      that either identify healthy controls from IBD patients or distinguish the 
      specific type of IBD are expected to be clinically important to serve as 
      biomarkers.

AB  - After the initiation of Human Microbiome Project in 2008, various biostatistic 
      and bioinformatic tools for data analysis and computational methods have been 
      developed and applied to microbiome studies. In this review and perspective, we 
      discuss the research and statistical hypotheses in gut microbiome studies, 
      focusing on mechanistic concepts that underlie the complex relationships among 
      host, microbiome, and environment. We review the current available statistic 
      tools and highlight recent progress of newly developed statistical methods and 
      models. Given the current challenges and limitations in biostatistic approaches 
      and tools, we discuss the future direction in developing statistical methods and 
      models for the microbiome studies.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of bile salt biotransformation in the human gut microbiome.
PG  - 517
LID - 10.1186/s12864-019-5899-3 [doi]
LID - 517
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the biochemical milieu of human colon, bile acids act as signaling 
      mediators between the host and its gut microbiota. Biotransformation of primary 
      to secondary bile acids have been known to be involved in the immune regulation 
      of human physiology. Several 16S amplicon-based studies with inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD) subjects were found to have an association with the level of fecal 
      bile acids. However, a detailed investigation of all the bile salt 
      biotransformation genes in the gut microbiome of healthy and IBD subjects has not 
      been performed. RESULTS: Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the bile 
      salt biotransformation genes and their distribution at the phyla level. Based on 
      the analysis of shotgun metagenomes, we found that the IBD subjects harbored a 
      significantly lower abundance of these genes compared to the healthy controls. 
      Majority of these genes originated from Firmicutes in comparison to other phyla. 
      From metabolomics data, we found that the IBD subjects were measured with a 
      significantly low level of secondary bile acids and high levels of primary bile 
      acids compared to that of the healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      bioinformatics-driven approach of identifying bile salt biotransformation genes 
      predicts the bile salt biotransformation potential in the gut microbiota of IBD 
      subjects. The functional level of dysbiosis likely contributes to the variation 
      in the bile acid pool. This study sets the stage to envisage potential solutions 
      to modulate the gut microbiome with the objective to restore the bile acid pool 
      in the gut.

AB  - Associations between the human gut microbiome and expression of host illness have 
      been noted in a variety of conditions ranging from gastrointestinal dysfunctions 
      to neurological deficits. Machine learning (ML) methods have generated promising 
      results for disease prediction from gut metagenomic information for diseases 
      including liver cirrhosis and irritable bowel disease, but have lacked efficacy 
      when predicting other illnesses. Here, we review current ML methods designed for 
      disease classification from microbiome data. We highlight the computational 
      challenges these methods have effectively overcome and discuss the biological 
      components that have been overlooked to offer perspectives on future work in this 
      area.

TI  - SIMMER employs similarity algorithms to accurately identify human gut microbiome 
      species and enzymes capable of known chemical transformations.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.82401 [doi]
LID - e82401
AB  - Bacteria within the gut microbiota possess the ability to metabolize a wide array 
      of human drugs, foods, and toxins, but the responsible enzymes for these chemical 
      events remain largely uncharacterized due to the time-consuming nature of current 
      experimental approaches. Attempts have been made in the past to computationally 
      predict which bacterial species and enzymes are responsible for chemical 
      transformations in the gut environment, but with low accuracy due to minimal 
      chemical representation and sequence similarity search schemes. Here, we present 
      an in silico approach that employs chemical and protein Similarity algorithms 
      that Identify MicrobioMe Enzymatic Reactions (SIMMER). We show that SIMMER 
      accurately predicts the responsible species and enzymes for a queried reaction, 
      unlike previous methods. We demonstrate SIMMER use cases in the context of drug 
      metabolism by predicting previously uncharacterized enzymes for 88 drug 
      transformations known to occur in the human gut. We validate these predictions on 
      external datasets and provide an in vitro validation of SIMMER's predictions for 
      metabolism of methotrexate, an anti-arthritic drug. After demonstrating its 
      utility and accuracy, we made SIMMER available as both a command-line and web 
      tool, with flexible input and output options for determining chemical 
      transformations within the human gut. We present SIMMER as a computational 
      addition to the microbiome researcher's toolbox, enabling them to make informed 
      hypotheses before embarking on the lengthy laboratory experiments required to 
      characterize novel bacterial enzymes that can alter human ingested compounds.

TI  - Assessment of metagenomic workflows using a newly constructed human gut 
      microbiome mock community.
LID - 10.1093/dnares/dsad010 [doi]
LID - dsad010
AB  - To quantify the biases introduced during human gut microbiome studies, analyzing 
      an artificial mock community as the reference microbiome is indispensable. 
      However, there are still limited resources for a mock community which well 
      represents the human gut microbiome. Here, we constructed a novel mock community 
      comprising the type strains of 18 major bacterial species in the human gut and 
      assessed the influence of experimental and bioinformatics procedures on the 16S 
      rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that DNA extraction 
      methods greatly affected the DNA yields and taxonomic composition of sequenced 
      reads, and that some of the commonly used primers for 16S rRNA genes were prone 
      to underestimate the abundance of some gut commensal taxa such as 
      Erysipelotrichia, Verrucomicrobiota and Methanobacteriota. Binning of the 
      assembled contigs of shotgun metagenomic sequences by MetaBAT2 produced 
      phylogenetically consistent, less-contaminated bins with varied completeness. The 
      ensemble approach of multiple binning tools by MetaWRAP can improve completeness 
      but sometimes increases the contamination rate. Our benchmark study provides an 
      important foundation for the interpretation of human gut microbiome data by 
      providing means for standardization among gut microbiome data obtained with 
      different methodologies and will facilitate further development of analytical 
      methods.

TI  - The standardisation of the approach to metagenomic human gut analysis: from 
      sample collection to microbiome profiling.
PG  - 8470
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-12037-3 [doi]
LID - 8470
AB  - In recent years, the number of metagenomic studies increased significantly. Wide 
      range of factors, including the tremendous community complexity and variability, 
      is contributing to the challenge in reliable microbiome community profiling. Many 
      approaches have been proposed to overcome these problems making hardly possible 
      to compare results of different studies. The significant differences between 
      procedures used in metagenomic research are reflected in a variation of the 
      obtained results. This calls for the need for standardisation of the procedure, 
      to reduce the confounding factors originating from DNA isolation, sequencing and 
      bioinformatics analyses in order to ensure that the differences in microbiome 
      composition are of a true biological origin. Although the best practices for 
      metagenomics studies have been the topic of several publications and the main aim 
      of the International Human Microbiome Standard (IHMS) project, standardisation of 
      the procedure for generating and analysing metagenomic data is still far from 
      being achieved. To highlight the difficulties in the standardisation of 
      metagenomics methods, we thoroughly examined each step of the analysis of the 
      human gut microbiome. We tested the DNA isolation procedure, preparation of NGS 
      libraries for next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis, aimed at 
      identifying microbial taxa. We showed that the homogenisation time is the leading 
      factor impacting sample diversity, with the recommendation for a shorter 
      homogenisation time (10 min). Ten minutes of homogenisation allows for better 
      reflection of the bacteria gram-positive/gram-negative ratio, and the obtained 
      results are the least heterogenous in terms of beta-diversity of samples 
      microbial composition. Besides increasing the homogenisation time, we observed 
      further potential impact of the library preparation kit on the gut microbiome 
      profiling. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the choice of the library 
      preparation kit influences the reproducibility of the results, which is an 
      important factor that has to be taken into account in every experiment. In this 
      study, a tagmentation-based kit allowed for obtaining the most reproducible 
      results. We also considered the choice of the computational tool for determining 
      the composition of intestinal microbiota, with Kraken2/Bracken pipeline 
      outperforming MetaPhlAn2 in our in silico experiments. The design of an 
      experiment and a detailed establishment of an experimental protocol may have a 
      serious impact on determining the taxonomic profile of the intestinal microbiome 
      community. Results of our experiment can be helpful for a wide range of studies 
      that aim to better understand the role of the gut microbiome, as well as for 
      clinical purposes.

TI  - Potential value of nutrigenomics in Crohn's disease.
PG  - 260-70
LID - 10.1038/nrgastro.2012.41 [doi]
AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition that has no certain cure. Both 
      genetic susceptibility and nutrition have key roles, but their level of 
      involvement varies between patients. Interacting gene pathways influence the 
      probability of disease development, but these are affected by stress and various 
      environmental factors, including diet. In addition, the role of the gut 
      microbiome must not be underestimated, as it is substantially altered in patients 
      with Crohn's disease. Although an elemental diet might lead to disease remission, 
      reintroducing real foods and sustainable diets in patients with Crohn's disease 
      is currently difficult, and would benefit from the sensitivity and rapid feedback 
      provided by the field of nutrigenomics. Nutrigenomics utilizes high-throughput 
      genomics technologies to reveal changes in gene and protein expression that are 
      modulated by the patient's nutrition. The most widely used technique thus far is 
      transcriptomics, which permits measurement of changes in the expression of 
      thousands of genes simultaneously in one sample. Given the volume of numbers 
      generated in such studies, data-basing and bioinformatics are essential to ensure 
      the correct application of nutrigenomics at the population level. These methods 
      have been successfully applied to animal models of Crohn's disease, and the time 
      is right to move them to human studies.

AB  - Metaproteomics is a relatively young field that has only been studied for 
      approximately 15 years. Nevertheless, it has the potential to play a key role in 
      disease research by elucidating the mechanisms of communication between the human 
      host and the microbiome. Although it has been useful in developing an 
      understanding of various diseases, its analytical strategies remain limited to 
      the extended application of proteomics. The sequence databases in metaproteomics 
      must be large because of the presence of thousands of species in a typical 
      sample, which causes problems unique to large databases. In this review, we 
      demonstrate the usefulness of metaproteomics in disease research through examples 
      from several studies. Additionally, we discuss the challenges of applying 
      metaproteomics to conventional proteomics analysis methods and introduce studies 
      that may provide clues to the solutions. We also discuss the need for a standard 
      false discovery rate control method for metaproteomics to replace common 
      target-decoy search approaches in proteomics and a method to ensure the 
      reliability of peptide spectrum match.

AB  - Recent studies revealed a significant role of the gut fungal community in human 
      health. Here, we investigated the content and variation of gut mycobiota among 
      subjects from the European population. We explored the interplay between gut 
      fungi and various host-related sociodemographic, lifestyle, health, and dietary 
      factors. The study included 923 participants. Fecal DNA samples were analyzed by 
      whole-metagenome high-throughput sequencing. Subsequently, fungi taxonomic 
      profiles were determined and accompanied by computational and statistical 
      analyses of the association with 53 host-related factors. Fungal communities were 
      characterized by a high prevalence of Saccharomyces, Candida, and Sporisorium. 
      Ten factors were found to correlate significantly with the overall mycobiota 
      variation. Most were diet related, including the consumption of chips, meat, 
      sodas, sweetening, processed food, and alcohol, followed by age and marital 
      status. Differences in α- and/or β-diversity were also reported for other factors 
      such as body mass index (BMI), job type, autoimmunological diseases, and 
      probiotics. Differential abundance analysis revealed fungal species that 
      exhibited different patterns of changes under specific conditions. The human gut 
      mycobiota is dominated by yeast, including Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and 
      Candida. Although intervolunteer variability was high, several fungal species 
      persisted across most samples, which may be evidence that a core gut mycobiota 
      exists. Moreover, we showed that host-related factors such as diet, age, and 
      marital status influence the variability of gut mycobiota. To our knowledge, this 
      is the first large and comprehensive study of the European cohort in terms of gut 
      mycobiota associations with such an extensive and differentiated host-related set 
      of factors. IMPORTANCE The human gut is inhabited by many organisms, including 
      bacteria and fungi, that may affect human health. However, research on human gut 
      mycobiome is still rare. Moreover, the large European-based cohort study is 
      missing. Here, we analyzed the first large European cohort in terms of gut 
      mycobiota associations with a differentiated host-related set of factors. Our 
      results showed that chips, meat, sodas, sweetening, processed food, beer, alcohol 
      consumption, age, and marital status were associated with the variability of gut 
      mycobiota. Moreover, our analysis revealed changes in abundances at the fungal 
      species level for many investigated factors. Our results can suggest potentially 
      valuable paths for further, narrowly focused research on gut mycobiome and its 
      impact on human health. In the coming era of gut microbiome-based precision 
      medicine, further research into the relationship between different mycobial 
      structures and host-related factors may result in new preventive approaches or 
      therapeutic procedures.

TI  - Predictive association of gut microbiome and NLR in anemic low middle-income 
      population of Odisha- a cross-sectional study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron is abundant on earth but not readily available for colonizing 
      bacteria due to its low solubility in the human body. Hosts and microbiota 
      compete fiercely for iron. <15% Supplemented Iron is absorbed in the small bowel, 
      and the remaining iron is a source of dysbiosis. The gut microbiome signatures to 
      the level of predicting anemia among low-middle-income populations are unknown. 
      The present study was conducted to identify gut microbiome signatures that have 
      predictive potential in association with Neutrophil to lymphocytes ratio (NLR) 
      and Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in anemia. METHODS: One hundred and four 
      participants between 10 and 70 years were recruited from Odisha's Low 
      Middle-Income (LMI) rural population. Hematological parameters such as Hemoglobin 
      (HGB), NLR, and MCV were measured, and NLR was categorized using percentiles. The 
      microbiome signatures were analyzed from 61 anemic and 43 non-anemic participants 
      using 16 s rRNA sequencing, followed by the Bioinformatics analysis performed to 
      identify the diversity, correlations, and indicator species. The Multi-Layered 
      Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) model were applied to predict anemia. RESULTS: 
      Significant microbiome diversity among anemic participants was observed between 
      the lower, middle, and upper Quartile NLR groups. For anemic participants with 
      NLR in the lower quartile, alpha indices indicated bacterial overgrowth, and 
      consistently, we identified R. faecis and B. uniformis were predominating. Using 
      ROC analysis, R. faecis had better distinction (AUC = 0.803) to predict anemia 
      with lower NLR. In contrast, E. biforme and H. parainfluenzae were indicators of 
      the NLR in the middle and upper quartile, respectively. While in Non-anemic 
      participants with low MCV, the bacterial alteration was inversely related to 
      gender. Furthermore, our Multi-Layered Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) models 
      also provided 89% accuracy in predicting Anemic or Non-Anemic from the top 20 
      OTUs, HGB level, NLR, MCV, and indicator species. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      strongly associate anemic hematological parameters and microbiome. Such 
      predictive association between the gut microbiome and NLR could be further 
      evaluated and utilized to design precision nutrition models and to predict Iron 
      supplementation and dietary intervention responses in both community and clinical 
      settings.

AB  - Azurin, a bacteriocin produced by a human gut bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
      can reveal selectively cytotoxic and induce apoptosis in cancer cells. After 
      overcoming two phase I trials, a functional region of Azurin called p28 has been 
      approved as a drug for the treatment of brain tumor glioma by FDA. The present 
      study aims to improve a screening procedure and assess genetic diversity of 
      Azurin genes in P. aeruginosa and Azurin-like genes in the gut microbiome of a 
      specific population in Vietnam and global populations. Firstly, both 
      cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent techniques based on genomic and 
      metagenomic DNAs extracted from fecal samples of the healthy specific population 
      were performed and optimized to detect Azurin genes. Secondly, the Azurin gene 
      sequences were analyzed and compared with global populations by using 
      bioinformatics tools. Finally, the screening procedure improved from the first 
      step was applied for screening Azurin-like genes, followed by the protein 
      synthesis and NCI in vitro screening for anticancer activity. As a result, this 
      study has successfully optimized the annealing temperatures to amplify DNAs for 
      screening Azurin genes and applying to Azurin-like genes from human gut 
      microbiota. The novelty of this study is the first of its kind to classify Azurin 
      genes into five different genotypes at a global scale and confirm the potential 
      anticancer activity of three Azurin-like synthetic proteins (Cnazu1, Dlazu11, and 
      Ruazu12). The results contribute to the procedure development applied for 
      screening anticancer proteins from human microbiome and a comprehensive 
      understanding of their therapeutic response at a genetic level.

TI  - Effects of proton pump inhibitor on the human gut microbiome profile in 
      multi-ethnic groups in Singapore.
PG  - 512-521
LID - 10.11622/smedj.2018152 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of 
      ethnicity, gender and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), omeprazole, on the human gut 
      microbiome. PPIs are commonly used for the treatment of acid-related disorders. 
      We hypothesised that PPI therapy might perturb microbial communities and alter 
      the gut microbiome. METHODS: Healthy subjects of Chinese (n = 12), Malay (n = 12) 
      and Indian (n = 10) ancestry, aged 21-37 years, were enrolled. They provided a 
      baseline stool sample (Day 1) and were then given a course of omeprazole at 
      therapeutic dose (20 mg daily) for seven days. Stool samples were collected again 
      on Day 7 and 14 (one week after stopping omeprazole). Microbial DNA was extracted 
      from the stool samples, followed by polymerase chain reaction, library 
      construction, 16S rRNA sequencing using Illumina MiSeq, and statistical and 
      bioinformatics analyses. RESULTS: The findings showed an increase in species 
      richness (p = 0.018) after omeprazole consumption on Day 7, which reverted to 
      baseline on Day 14. There were significant increases in the relative abundance of 
      Streptococcus vestibularis (p = 0.0001) and Veillonella dispar (p = 0.0001) on 
      Day 7, which diminished on Day 14. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Sutterella 
      stercoricanis and Bacteroides denticanum were characteristic of Chinese, Malays 
      and Indians, respectively. Lactobacillaceae and Bacteroides xylanisolvens were 
      the signature taxa of male and female subjects, respectively. CONCLUSION: The 
      study demonstrated alterations in the gut microbiome following omeprazole 
      treatment. This may explain the underlying pathology of increased risk of 
      Clostridium difficile infections associated with omeprazole therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication of 
      diabetes mellitus (DM) and is one of the leading causes of blindness among DM 
      patients. However, the molecular mechanism involving DR remains unclear. METHODS: 
      A case-control study with age-, sex-, and duration-matched diabetic patients and 
      controls was conducted, which included 15 type 2 DM (T2DM) patients with DR and 
      15 T2DM patients without DR. Shotgun sequencing and non-targeted metabolomic 
      profiling analyses of fecal samples were performed, and comprehensive 
      bioinformatics analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Using metagenomic analyses, we 
      identified 293,460 unique genes in the non-DR group, while that in the DR group 
      was 283,235, and the number of overlapping genes was 1,237,914. Regarding phylum 
      levels, Actinobacteria decreased but Bacteroidetes increased in the DR group when 
      compared with those in the control group. Regarding genus levels, Bifidobacterium 
      and Lactobacillus decreased. Cellular processes, environmental information 
      processes, and metabolism-related pathways were found at higher levels in the gut 
      microbiome of DR patients. Using metabolomic analyses, we found 116 
      differentially expressed metabolites with a positive ion model and 168 
      differentially expressed metabolites with a negative ion model between the two 
      groups. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotation revealed six pathways 
      with different levels between DR and diabetic controls, namely, cellular 
      processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, 
      human diseases, organismal systems and metabolism. Moreover, lysine biosynthesis 
      and lysine degradation were enriched using a positive model, but histidine 
      metabolism and β-alanine metabolism were enriched using a negative model. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Together, the metagenomic profiles of DR patients indicated 
      different gut microbiota compositions and characteristic fecal metabolic 
      phenotypes in DR patients. Our findings of microbial pathways therefore provided 
      potential etiological and therapeutic targets for DR patients.

AB  - The human gut microbiome impacts several aspects of human health and disease, 
      including digestion, drug metabolism and the propensity to develop various 
      inflammatory, autoimmune and metabolic diseases. Many of the molecular processes 
      that play a role in the activity and dynamics of the microbiota go beyond species 
      and genic composition and thus, their understanding requires advanced 
      bioinformatics support. This article aims to provide an up-to-date view of the 
      resources and software tools that are being developed and used in human gut 
      microbiome research, in particular data integration and systems-level analysis 
      efforts. These efforts demonstrate the power of standardized and reproducible 
      computational workflows for integrating and analysing varied omics data and 
      gaining deeper insights into microbe community structure and function as well as 
      host-microbe interactions.

TI  - Extensive transmission of microbes along the gastrointestinal tract.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.42693 [doi]
LID - e42693
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is abundantly colonized by microbes, yet the 
      translocation of oral species to the intestine is considered a rare aberrant 
      event, and a hallmark of disease. By studying salivary and fecal microbial strain 
      populations of 310 species in 470 individuals from five countries, we found that 
      transmission to, and subsequent colonization of, the large intestine by oral 
      microbes is common and extensive among healthy individuals. We found evidence for 
      a vast majority of oral species to be transferable, with increased levels of 
      transmission in colorectal cancer and rheumatoid arthritis patients and, more 
      generally, for species described as opportunistic pathogens. This establishes the 
      oral cavity as an endogenous reservoir for gut microbial strains, and oral-fecal 
      transmission as an important process that shapes the gastrointestinal microbiome 
      in health and disease.

TI  - metaSNV v2: detection of SNVs and subspecies in prokaryotic metagenomes.
PG  - 1162-1164
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btab789 [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Taxonomic analysis of microbial communities is well supported at the 
      level of species and strains. However, species can contain significant phenotypic 
      diversity and strains are rarely widely shared across global populations. 
      Stratifying the diversity between species and strains can identify 'subspecies', 
      which are a useful intermediary. High-throughput identification and profiling of 
      subspecies is not yet supported in the microbiome field. Here, we use an 
      operational definition of subspecies based on single nucleotide variant (SNV) 
      patterns within species to identify and profile subspecies in metagenomes, along 
      with their distinctive SNVs and genes. We incorporate this method into metaSNV 
      v2, which extends existing SNV-calling software to support further SNV 
      interpretation for population genetics. These new features support microbiome 
      analyses to link SNV profiles with host phenotype or environment and 
      niche-specificity. We demonstrate subspecies identification in marine and fecal 
      metagenomes. In the latter, we analyze 70 species in 7524 adult and infant 
      subjects, supporting a common subspecies population structure in the human gut 
      microbiome and illustrating some limits in subspecies calling. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: Source code, documentation, tutorials and test data are available 
      at https://github.com/metasnv-tool/metaSNV and https://metasnv.embl.de.

TI  - Potential mechanism of pyrotinib-induced diarrhea was explored by gut microbiome 
      and ileum metabolomics.
PG  - 747-762
LID - 10.1097/CAD.0000000000001440 [doi]
AB  - Pyrotinib is a novel epidermal growth factor receptor/human epidermal growth 
      factor receptor-2 (HER2) tyrosine kinase inhibitor that exhibited clinical 
      efficacy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and HER2-mutant/amplified 
      lung cancer. However, severe diarrhea adverse responses preclude its practical 
      use. At present, the mechanism of pyrotinib-induced diarrhea is unknown and needs 
      further study. First, to develop a suitable and reproducible animal model, we 
      compared the effects of different doses of pyrotinib (20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/kg) in 
      Wistar rats. Second, we used this model to examine the intestinal toxicity of 
      pyrotinib. Finally, the mechanism underlying pyrotinib-induced diarrhea was fully 
      studied using gut microbiome and host intestinal tissue metabolomics profiling. 
      Reproducible diarrhea occurred in rats when they were given an 80 mg/kg daily 
      dose of pyrotinib. Using the pyrotinib-induced model, we observed that 
      Lachnospiraceae and Acidaminococcaceae decreased in the pyrotinib groups, whereas 
      Enterobacteriaceae, Helicobacteraceae and Clostridiaceae increased at the family 
      level by 16S rRNA gene sequence. Multiple bioinformatics methods revealed that 
      glycocholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid and cyclic AMP increased in the pyrotinib 
      groups, whereas kynurenic acid decreased, which may be related to the 
      pathogenesis of pyrotinib-induced diarrhea. Additionally, pyrotinib-induced 
      diarrhea may be associated with a number of metabolic changes mediated by the gut 
      microbiome, such as Primary bile acid biosynthesis. We reported the establishment 
      of a reproducible pyrotinib-induced animal model for the first time. Furthermore, 
      we concluded from this experiment that gut microbiome imbalance and changes in 
      related metabolites are significant contributors to pyrotinib-induced diarrhea.

AB  - Huge of previous reports recommended that gut microbiome have a crucial role in 
      the human health and its change was profound impact for the metabolic 
      improvements associated with lipids metabolism. In order to explore the relevance 
      of a direct dysbiosis effect of gut microbiome on lipids metabolism shifts and 
      repaired position of DHA, we built the animal model for the study with gut 
      microbiome dysbiosis administrated by i.g. with CRO and intervened by DHA in the 
      present work. Gut microbiome was analyzed by high throughput sequencing and 
      bioinformatics analyses of bacteria. The composition of fatty acids and short 
      chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were determined by gas chromatography. Blood lipids and 
      bile acids were assayed by kit and UPLC-MS/MS, respectively. The expressions of 
      enzymes of long chain fatty acid metabolism were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results 
      showed that gut microbiome dysbiosis caused lipid metabolism abnormal, and DHA 
      was able to repair the lipids metabolism shifts resulted from gut microbiome 
      dysbiosis. DHA could modulate host-gut microbiome signatures, improve 
      concentrations of SCFAs, regulate fatty acids metabolism but modify bile acid 
      profiles. In conclusion, we considered that DHA repaired lipid metabolism by 
      modulating gut microbiome and regulating fatty acids metabolism pathway.

TI  - Impact of the Post-Transplant Period and Lifestyle Diseases on Human Gut 
      Microbiota in Kidney Graft Recipients.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8111724 [doi]
LID - 1724
AB  - Gaining long-term graft function and patient life quality remain critical 
      challenges following kidney transplantation. Advances in immunology, 
      gnotobiotics, and culture-independent molecular techniques have provided growing 
      insights into the complex relationship of the microbiome and the host. However, 
      little is known about the over time-shift of the gut microbiota in the context of 
      kidney transplantation and its impact on both graft and health stability. Here we 
      aimed to characterize the structure of gut microbiota within stable kidney graft 
      recipients. We enrolled forty kidney transplant patients after at least three 
      months of transplantation and compared them to eighteen healthy controls. The 
      overall microbial community structure of the kidney transplanted group was 
      clearly different from control subjects. We found lower relative abundances of 
      Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia within the patient group and a 
      higher abundance of Proteobacteria compared to the control group. Both richness 
      and Shannon diversity indexes were significantly lower in the kidney graft 
      recipients than in healthy controls. Post-graft period was positively correlated 
      with the relative abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum, especially 
      Escherichia.Shigella genus. Interestingly, only Parabacteroides was found to 
      significantly differentiate patients that were not suffering from lifestyle 
      diseases and those who suffer from post-graft complications. Furthermore, network 
      analysis showed that the occurrence of lifestyle diseases was significantly 
      linked with a higher number of negative interactions of Sutterella and 
      Succinivibrio genera within patients. This study characterizes gut microbiome 
      fluctuation in stable kidney transplant patients after a long post-allograft 
      period. Analysis of fecal microbiota could be useful for nephrologists as a new 
      clinical tool that can improve kidney allograft monitoring and outcomes.

AB  - Changes in the relative abundances of many intestinal microorganisms, both those 
      that naturally occur in the human gut microbiome and those that are considered 
      pathogens, have been associated with a range of diseases. To more accurately 
      diagnose health conditions, medical practitioners could benefit from a molecular, 
      culture-independent assay for the quantification of these microorganisms in the 
      context of a healthy reference range. Here we present the targeted sequencing of 
      the microbial 16S rRNA gene of clinically relevant gut microorganisms as a method 
      to provide a gut screening test that could assist in the clinical diagnosis of 
      certain health conditions. We evaluated the possibility of detecting 46 clinical 
      prokaryotic targets in the human gut, 28 of which could be identified with high 
      precision and sensitivity by a bioinformatics pipeline that includes sequence 
      analysis and taxonomic annotation. These targets included 20 commensal, 3 
      beneficial (probiotic), and 5 pathogenic intestinal microbial taxa. Using stool 
      microbiome samples from a cohort of 897 healthy individuals, we established a 
      reference range defining clinically relevant relative levels for each of the 28 
      targets. Our assay quantifies 28 targets in the context of a healthy reference 
      range and correctly reflected 38/38 verification samples of real and synthetic 
      stool material containing known gut pathogens. Thus, we have established a method 
      to determine microbiome composition with a focus on clinically relevant taxa, 
      which has the potential to contribute to patient diagnosis, treatment, and 
      monitoring. More broadly, our method can facilitate epidemiological studies of 
      the microbiome as it relates to overall human health and disease.

TI  - Arsenic disturbs the gut microbiome of individuals in a disadvantaged community 
      in Nepal.
PG  - e03313
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03313 [doi]
LID - e03313
AB  - Arsenic is ubiquitous in nature, highly toxic, and is particularly abundant in 
      Southern Asia. While many studies have focused on areas like Bangladesh and West 
      Bengal, India, disadvantaged regions within Nepal have also suffered from arsenic 
      contamination levels, with wells and other water sources possessing arsenic 
      contamination over the recommended WHO and EPA limit of 10 μg/L, some wells 
      reporting levels as high as 500 μg/L. Despite the region's pronounced arsenic 
      concentrations within community water sources, few investigations have been 
      conducted to understand the impact of arsenic contamination on host gut 
      microbiota health. This study aims to examine differential arsenic exposure on 
      the gut microbiome structure within two disadvantaged communities in southern 
      Nepal. Fecal samples (n = 42) were collected from members of the Mahuawa (n = 20) 
      and Ghanashyampur (n = 22) communities in southern Nepal. The 16S rRNA gene was 
      amplified from fecal samples using Illumina-tag PCR and subject to 
      high-throughput sequencing to generate the bacterial community structure of each 
      sample. Bioinformatics analysis and multivariate statistics were conducted to 
      identify if specific fecal bacterial assemblages and predicted functions were 
      correlated with urine arsenic concentration. Our results revealed unique 
      assemblages of arsenic volatilizing and pathogenic bacteria positively correlated 
      with increased arsenic concentration in individuals within the two respective 
      communities. Additionally, we observed that commensal gut bacteria negatively 
      correlated with increased arsenic concentration in the two respective 
      communities. Our study has revealed that arsenic poses a broader human health 
      risk than was previously known. It is influential in shaping the gut microbiome 
      through its enrichment of arsenic volatilizing and pathogenic bacteria and 
      subsequent depletion of gut commensals. This aspect of arsenic has the potential 
      to debilitate healthy humans by contributing to disorders like heart and liver 
      cancers and diabetes, and it has already been shown to contribute to serious 
      diseases and disorders, including skin lesions, gangrene and several types of 
      skin, renal, lung, and liver cancers in disadvantaged areas of the world like 
      Nepal.

TI  - A distance-based approach for testing the mediation effect of the human 
      microbiome.
PG  - 1875-1883
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty014 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Recent studies have revealed a complex interplay between environment, 
      the human microbiome and health and disease. Mediation analysis of the human 
      microbiome in these complex relationships could potentially provide insights into 
      the role of the microbiome in the etiology of disease and, more importantly, lead 
      to novel clinical interventions by modulating the microbiome. However, due to the 
      high dimensionality, sparsity, non-normality and phylogenetic structure of 
      microbiome data, none of the existing methods are suitable for testing such 
      clinically important mediation effect. RESULTS: We propose a distance-based 
      approach for testing the mediation effect of the human microbiome. In the 
      framework, the nonlinear relationship between the human microbiome and 
      independent/dependent variables is captured implicitly through the use of 
      sample-wise ecological distances, and the phylogenetic tree information is 
      conveniently incorporated by using phylogeny-based distance metrics. Multiple 
      distance metrics are utilized to maximize the power to detect various types of 
      mediation effect. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method has correct Type 
      I error control, and is robust and powerful under various mediation models. 
      Application to a real gut microbiome dataset revealed that the association 
      between the dietary fiber intake and body mass index was mediated by the gut 
      microbiome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: An R package 'MedTest' is freely 
      available at https://github.com/jchen1981/MedTest. CONTACT: zhiwei@njit.edu or

TI  - MetaQuery: a web server for rapid annotation and quantitative analysis of 
      specific genes in the human gut microbiome.

AB  - Microbiome researchers frequently want to know how abundant a particular 
      microbial gene or pathway is across different human hosts, including its 
      association with disease and its co-occurrence with other genes or microbial 
      taxa. With thousands of publicly available metagenomes, these questions should be 
      easy to answer. However, computational barriers prevent most researchers from 
      conducting such analyses. We address this problem with MetaQuery, a web 
      application for rapid and quantitative analysis of specific genes in the human 
      gut microbiome. The user inputs one or more query genes, and our software returns 
      the estimated abundance of these genes across 1267 publicly available fecal 
      metagenomes from American, European and Chinese individuals. In addition, our 
      application performs downstream statistical analyses to identify features that 
      are associated with gene variation, including other query genes (i.e. gene 
      co-variation), taxa, clinical variables (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease and 
      diabetes) and average genome size. The speed and accessibility of MetaQuery are a 
      step toward democratizing metagenomics research, which should allow many 
      researchers to query the abundance and variation of specific genes in the human 
      gut microbiome. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: http://metaquery.docpollard.org.

TI  - MetaQUBIC: a computational pipeline for gene-level functional profiling of 
      metagenome and metatranscriptome.
PG  - 4474-4477
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz414 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses can provide an abundance 
      of information related to microbial communities. However, straightforward 
      analysis of this data does not provide optimal results, with a required 
      integration of data types being needed to thoroughly investigate these 
      microbiomes and their environmental interactions. RESULTS: Here, we present 
      MetaQUBIC, an integrated biclustering-based computational pipeline for gene 
      module detection that integrates both metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. 
      Additionally, we used this pipeline to investigate 735 paired DNA and RNA human 
      gut microbiome samples, resulting in a comprehensive hybrid gene expression 
      matrix of 2.3 million cross-species genes in the 735 human fecal samples and 155 
      functional enriched gene modules. We believe both the MetaQUBIC pipeline and the 
      generated comprehensive human gut hybrid expression matrix will facilitate 
      further investigations into multiple levels of microbiome studies. AVAILABILITY

TI  - pepFunk: a tool for peptide-centric functional analysis of metaproteomic human 
      gut microbiome studies.
PG  - 4171-4179
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa289 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Enzymatic digestion of proteins before mass spectrometry analysis is 
      a key process in metaproteomic workflows. Canonical metaproteomic data processing 
      pipelines typically involve matching spectra produced by the mass spectrometer to 
      a theoretical spectra database, followed by matching the identified peptides back 
      to parent-proteins. However, the nature of enzymatic digestion produces peptides 
      that can be found in multiple proteins due to conservation or chance, presenting 
      difficulties with protein and functional assignment. RESULTS: To combat this 
      challenge, we developed pepFunk, a peptide-centric metaproteomic workflow focused 
      on the analysis of human gut microbiome samples. Our workflow includes a curated 
      peptide database annotated with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
      terms and a gene set variation analysis-inspired pathway enrichment adapted for 
      peptide-level data. Analysis using our peptide-centric workflow is fast and 
      highly correlated to a protein-centric analysis, and can identify more enriched 
      KEGG pathways than analysis using protein-level data. Our workflow is open source 
      and available as a web application or source code to be run locally. AVAILABILITY 
      AND IMPLEMENTATION: pepFunk is available online as a web application at 
      https://shiny.imetalab.ca/pepFunk/ with open-source code available from 
      https://github.com/northomics/pepFunk. CONTACT: dfigeys@uottawa.ca. SUPPLEMENTARY

TI  - Ancient acquisition of "alginate utilization loci" by human gut microbiota.
PG  - 8075
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-26104-1 [doi]
LID - 8075
AB  - In bacteria from the phylum Bacteroidetes, the genes coding for enzymes involved 
      in polysaccharide degradation are often colocalized and coregulated in so-called 
      "polysaccharide utilization loci" (PULs). PULs dedicated to the degradation of 
      marine polysaccharides (e.g. laminaran, ulvan, alginate and porphyran) have been 
      characterized in marine bacteria. Interestingly, the gut microbiome of Japanese 
      individuals acquired, by lateral transfer from marine bacteria, the genes 
      involved in the breakdown of porphyran, the cell wall polysaccharide of the red 
      seaweed used in maki. Sequence similarity analyses predict that the human gut 
      microbiome also encodes enzymes for the degradation of alginate, the main cell 
      wall polysaccharide of brown algae. We undertook the functional characterization 
      of diverse polysaccharide lyases from family PL17, frequently found in marine 
      bacteria as well as those of human gut bacteria. We demonstrate here that this 
      family is polyspecific. Our phylogenetic analysis of family PL17 reveals that all 
      alginate lyases, which have all the same specificity and mode of action, cluster 
      together in a very distinct subfamily. The alginate lyases found in human gut 
      bacteria group together in a single clade which is rooted deeply in the PL17 
      tree. These enzymes were found in PULs containing PL6 enzymes, which also 
      clustered together in the phylogenetic tree of PL6. Together, biochemical and 
      bioinformatics analyses suggest that acquisition of this system appears ancient 
      and, because only traces of two successful transfers were detected upon 
      inspection of PL6 and PL17 families, the pace of acquisition of marine 
      polysaccharide degradation system is probably very slow.

TI  - Deep Metaproteomics Approach for the Study of Human Microbiomes.
PG  - 9407-9415
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b02224 [doi]
AB  - Host-microbiome interactions have been shown to play important roles in human 
      health and diseases. Most of the current studies of the microbiome have been 
      performed by genomic approaches through next-generation sequencing. Technologies, 
      such as metaproteomics, for functional analysis of the microbiome are needed to 
      better understand the intricate host-microbiome interactions. However, 
      significant efforts to improve the depth and resolution of gut metaproteomics are 
      still required. In this study, we combined an efficient sample preparation 
      technique, high resolution mass spectrometry, and metaproteomic bioinformatics 
      tools to perform ultradeep metaproteomic analysis of human gut microbiome from 
      stool. We reported the deepest analysis of the microbiome to date with an average 
      of 20 558 protein groups identified per sample analysis. Moreover, strain 
      resolution taxonomic and pathway analysis using deep metaproteomics revealed 
      strain level variations, in particular for Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, in the 
      microbiome from the different individuals. We also reported that the human 
      proteins identified in stool samples are functionally enriched in extracellular 
      region pathways and in particular those proteins involved in defense response 
      against microbial organisms. Deep metaproteomics is a promising approach to 
      perform in-depth microbiome analysis and simultaneously reveals both human and 
      microbial changes that are not readily apparent using the standard genomic 
      approaches.

AB  - There are two major sequencing technologies for investigating the microbiome: the 
      amplicon sequencing that generates the OTU (operational taxonomic unit) tables of 
      marker genes (e.g., bacterial 16S-rRNA), and the metagenomic shotgun sequencing 
      that generates metagenomic gene abundance (MGA) tables. The OTU table is the 
      counterpart of species abundance tables in macrobial ecology of plants and 
      animals, and has been the target of numerous ecological and network analyses in 
      recent gold rush for microbiome research and in great efforts for establishing an 
      inclusive theoretical ecology. Nevertheless, MGA analyses have been largely 
      limited to bioinformatics pipelines and ad hoc statistical methods, and 
      systematic approaches to MGAs guided by classic ecological theories are still 
      few. Here, we argue that, the difference between "gene kinds" and "gene species" 
      are nominal, and the metagenome that a microbiota carries is essentially a 
      'community' of metagenomic genes (MGs). Each row of a MGA table represents a 
      metagenome of a microbiota, and the whole MGA table represents a 
      'meta-metagenome' (or an assemblage of metagenomes) of N microbiotas (microbiome 
      samples). Consequently, the same ecological/network analyses used in OTU analyses 
      should be equally applicable to MGA tables. Here we choose to analyze the 
      heterogeneity of metagenome by introducing classic Taylor's power law (TPL) and 
      its recent extensions in community ecology. Heterogeneity is a fundamental 
      property of metagenome, particularly in the context of human microbiomes. Recent 
      studies have shown that the heterogeneity of human metagenomes is far more 
      significant than that of human genomes. Therefore, without deep understanding of 
      the human metagenome heterogeneity, personalized medicine of the human 
      microbiome-associated diseases is hardly feasible. The TPL extensions have been 
      successfully applied to measure the heterogeneity of human microbiome based on 
      amplicon-sequencing reads of marker genes (e.g., 16s-rRNA). In this article, we 
      demonstrate the analysis of the metagenomic heterogeneity of human gut microbiome 
      at whole metagenome scale (with type-I power law extension) and metagenomic gene 
      scale (type-III), as well as the heterogeneity of gene clusters, respectively. We 
      further examine the influences of obesity, IBD and diabetes on the heterogeneity, 
      which is of important ramifications for the diagnosis and treatment of human 
      microbiome-associated diseases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutrient composition of vegetarian diets is greatly different from 
      that of omnivore diets, which may fundamentally influence the gut microbiota and 
      fecal metabolites. The interactions between diet pattern and gut environment need 
      further illustration. This study aims to compare the difference in the gut 
      microbiota and fecal metabolites between vegetarian and omnivore female adults 
      and explore associations between dietary choices/duration and gut environment 
      changes. METHODS: In this study, investigations on the fecal metabolome together 
      with the gut microbiome were performed to describe potential interactions with 
      quantitative functional annotation. In order to eliminate the differences brought 
      by factors of gender and living environment, 80 female adults aged 20 to 48 were 
      recruited in the universities in Beijing, China. Quantitative Insights Into 
      Microbial Ecology (QIIME) analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were 
      applied to screen differential data between groups from gut microbiota and fecal 
      metabolites. Furthermore, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was 
      employed as the bioinformatics analysis tool for describing the correlations 
      between gut microbiota and fecal metabolites. Moreover, participants were further 
      subdivided by the vegetarian diet duration for analysis. RESULTS: GPCR-mediated 
      integration of enteroendocrine signaling was predicted to be one of the 
      regulatory mechanisms of the vegetarian diet. Intriguingly, changes in the gut 
      environment which occurred along with the vegetarian diet showed attenuated trend 
      as the duration increased. A similar trend of returning to "baseline" after a 
      10-year vegetarian diet was detected in both gut microbiota and fecal metabolome. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The vegetarian diet is beneficial more than harmful to women. Gut 
      microbiota play roles in the ability of the human body to adapt to external 
      changes.

AB  - Microbes live in complex communities that are of major importance for 
      environmental ecology, public health, and animal physiology and pathology. 
      Short-read metagenomic shotgun sequencing is currently the state-of-the-art 
      technique for exploring these communities. With the aid of metagenomics, our 
      understanding of the microbiome is moving from composition toward functionality, 
      even down to the genetic variant level. While the exploration of 
      single-nucleotide variation in a genome is a standard procedure in genomics, and 
      many sophisticated tools exist to perform this task, identification of genetic 
      variation in metagenomes remains challenging. Major factors that hamper the 
      widespread application of variant-calling analysis include low-depth sequencing 
      of individual genomes (which is especially significant for the microorganisms 
      present in low abundance), the existence of large genomic variation even within 
      the same species, the absence of comprehensive reference genomes, and the noise 
      introduced by next-generation sequencing errors. Some bioinformatics tools, such 
      as metaSNV or InStrain, have been created to identify genetic variants in 
      metagenomes, but the performance of these tools has not been systematically 
      assessed or compared with the variant callers commonly used on single or pooled 
      genomes. In this study, we benchmark seven bioinformatic tools for genetic 
      variant calling in metagenomics data and assess their performance. To do so, we 
      simulated metagenomic reads to mimic human microbial composition, sequencing 
      errors, and genetic variability. We also simulated different conditions, 
      including low and high depth of coverage and unique or multiple strains per 
      species. Our analysis of the simulated data shows that probabilistic method-based 
      tools such as HaplotypeCaller and Mutect2 from the GATK toolset show the best 
      performance. By applying these tools to longitudinal gut microbiome data from the 
      Human Microbiome Project, we show that the genetic similarity between 
      longitudinal samples from the same individuals is significantly greater than the 
      similarity between samples from different individuals. Our benchmark shows that 
      probabilistic tools can be used to call metagenomes, and we recommend the use of 
      GATK's tools as reliable variant callers for metagenomic samples.

      Gut Microbiota.
LID - 10.1128/mBio.01348-18 [doi]
LID - e01348-18
AB  - Our knowledge of how the gut microbiome relates to mammalian evolution benefits 
      from the identification of gut microbial taxa that are unexpectedly prevalent or 
      unexpectedly conserved across mammals. Such taxa enable experimental 
      determination of the traits needed for such microbes to succeed as gut 
      generalists, as well as those traits that impact mammalian fitness. However, the 
      punctuated resolution of microbial taxonomy may limit our ability to detect 
      conserved gut microbes, especially in cases in which broadly related microbial 
      lineages possess shared traits that drive their apparent ubiquity across mammals. 
      To advance the discovery of conserved mammalian gut microbes, we developed a 
      novel ecophylogenetic approach to taxonomy that groups microbes into taxonomic 
      units based on their shared ancestry and their common distribution across 
      mammals. Applying this approach to previously generated gut microbiome data 
      uncovered monophyletic clades of gut bacteria that are conserved across mammals. 
      It also resolved microbial clades exclusive to and conserved among particular 
      mammalian lineages. Conserved clades often manifest phylogenetic patterns, such 
      as cophylogeny with their host, that indicate that they are subject to selective 
      processes, such as host filtering. Moreover, this analysis identified variation 
      in the rate at which mammals acquire or lose conserved microbial clades and 
      resolved a human-accelerated loss of conserved clades. Collectively, the data 
      from this study reveal mammalian gut microbiota that possess traits linked to 
      mammalian phylogeny, point to the existence of a core set of microbes that 
      comprise the mammalian gut microbiome, and clarify potential evolutionary or 
      ecologic mechanisms driving the gut microbiome's diversification throughout 
      mammalian evolution.IMPORTANCE Our understanding of mammalian evolution has 
      become microbiome-aware. While emerging research links mammalian biodiversity and 
      the gut microbiome, we lack insight into which microbes potentially impact 
      mammalian evolution. Microbes common to diverse mammalian species may be strong 
      candidates, as their absence in the gut may affect how the microbiome 
      functionally contributes to mammalian physiology to adversely affect fitness. 
      Identifying such conserved gut microbes is thus important to ultimately assessing 
      the microbiome's potential role in mammalian evolution. To advance their 
      discovery, we developed an approach that identifies ancestrally related groups of 
      microbes that distribute across mammals in a way that indicates their collective 
      conservation. These conserved clades are presumed to have evolved a trait in 
      their ancestor that matters to their distribution across mammals and which has 
      been retained among clade members. We found not only that such clades do exist 
      among mammals but also that they appear to be subject to natural selection and 
      characterize human evolution.

TI  - MetaProClust-MS1: an MS1 Profiling Approach for Large-Scale Microbiome Screening.
PG  - e0038122

LID - e00381-22
AB  - Metaproteomics is used to explore the functional dynamics of microbial 
      communities. However, acquiring metaproteomic data by tandem mass spectrometry 
      (MS/MS) is time-consuming and resource-intensive, and there is a demand for 
      computational methods that can be used to reduce these resource requirements. We 
      present MetaProClust-MS1, a computational framework for microbiome feature 
      screening developed to prioritize samples for follow-up MS/MS. In this 
      proof-of-concept study, we tested and compared MetaProClust-MS1 results on gut 
      microbiome data, from fecal samples, acquired using short 15-min MS1-only 
      chromatographic gradients and MS1 spectra from longer 60-min gradients to 
      MS/MS-acquired data. We found that MetaProClust-MS1 identified robust gut 
      microbiome responses caused by xenobiotics with significantly correlated cluster 
      topologies of comparable data sets. We also used MetaProClust-MS1 to reanalyze 
      data from both a clinical MS/MS diagnostic study of pediatric patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease and an experiment evaluating the therapeutic effects 
      of a small molecule on the brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease mouse models. 
      MetaProClust-MS1 clusters could distinguish between inflammatory bowel disease 
      diagnoses (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) using samples from mucosal 
      luminal interface samples and identified hippocampal proteome shifts of 
      Alzheimer's disease mouse models after small-molecule treatment. Therefore, we 
      demonstrate that MetaProClust-MS1 can screen both microbiomes and single-species 
      proteomes using only MS1 profiles, and our results suggest that this approach may 
      be generalizable to any proteomics experiment. MetaProClust-MS1 may be especially 
      useful for large-scale metaproteomic screening for the prioritization of samples 
      for further metaproteomic characterization, using MS/MS, for instance, in 
      addition to being a promising novel approach for clinical diagnostic screening. 
      IMPORTANCE Growing evidence suggests that human gut microbiome composition and 
      function are highly associated with health and disease. As such, high-throughput 
      metaproteomic studies are becoming more common in gut microbiome research. 
      However, using a conventional long liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS gradient 
      metaproteomics approach as an initial screen in large-scale microbiome 
      experiments can be slow and expensive. To combat this challenge, we introduce 
      MetaProClust-MS1, a computational framework for microbiome screening using 
      MS1-only profiles. In this proof-of-concept study, we show that MetaProClust-MS1 
      identifies clusters of gut microbiome treatments using MS1-only profiles similar 
      to those identified using MS/MS. Our approach allows researchers to prioritize 
      samples and treatments of interest for further metaproteomic analyses and may be 
      generally applicable to any proteomic analysis. In particular, this approach may 
      be especially useful for large-scale metaproteomic screening or in clinical 
      settings where rapid diagnostic evidence is required.

TI  - Impact of a Nomadic Pastoral Lifestyle on the Gut Microbiome in the Fulani Living 
      in Nigeria.

AB  - The co-evolution of the gut microbiota with its human host has revolutionized our 
      current scientific viewpoint about the contribution of diet and lifestyle on 
      human health. Most studies so far have focused on populations living in the 
      United States and Europe or compared those with communities from other geographic 
      areas in the world. In order to determine the taxonomic and predicted functional 
      profile of the gut microbiome of a hitherto unstudied human community, we 
      investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the gut microbiota in a community of 
      Fulani nomadic pastoralists, and their semi-urbanized neighbors - the Jarawa. The 
      Jarawa reside in a city (Jos) in the north-central part of Nigeria, and are 
      adapted in part to a westernized lifestyle. The nomadic Fulani lifestyle 
      resembles a mix of Paleolithic and Neolithic lifestyle patterns with a greater 
      predisposition to diseases. The fecal microbiota of the Fulani and the Jarawa 
      were characterized by paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, 
      followed by downstream bioinformatics analysis of the sequence reads. The Fulani 
      harbored increased numbers of signatures of microbes that are known to be 
      associated with a foraging lifestyle such as the Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and 
      Prevotellaceae, while the Jarawa were dominated by signatures of Firmicutes, 
      Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Christensenellaceae. Notably, the gut 
      microbiota of the Fulani showed less taxonomic diversity than those of the 
      Jarawa. Although they reside in the same geographical zone, microbial community 
      composition was significantly different between the two groups. Pathogens were 
      predicted to be more abundant in the gut microbiota of the Fulani than of the 
      Jarawa. Predicted pathogenic pathways and pathways associated with the breakdown 
      of fiber-rich diet were enriched in the Fulani, including glutathione metabolism, 
      while pathways associated with the consumption of low-fiber diet and xenobiotics, 
      including fructose and mannose metabolic pathways, and nitrotoluene degradation 
      pathways, respectively, were enriched in the Jarawa. Significant differences in 
      composition between both groups were likely due to differences in diet and 
      lifestyle and exposure to pathogens. These results suggest that microbial 
      diversity may not always be higher in non-industrialized societies than in 
      westernized societies, as previously assumed.

TI  - Association of Diet and Antimicrobial Resistance in Healthy U.S. Adults.
PG  - e0010122

LID - e00101-22
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a significant source of morbidity and 
      mortality worldwide, with expectations that AMR-associated consequences will 
      continue to worsen throughout the coming decades. Since resistance to antibiotics 
      is encoded in the microbiome, interventions aimed at altering the taxonomic 
      composition of the gut might allow us to prophylactically engineer microbiomes 
      that harbor fewer antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs). Diet is one method of 
      intervention, and yet little is known about the association between diet and 
      antimicrobial resistance. To address this knowledge gap, we examined diet using 
      the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ; habitual diet) and 24-h dietary recalls 
      (Automated Self-Administered 24-h [ASA24(®)] tool) coupled with an analysis of 
      the microbiome using shotgun metagenome sequencing in 290 healthy adult 
      participants of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Nutritional 
      Phenotyping Study. We found that aminoglycosides were the most abundant and 
      prevalent mechanism of AMR in these healthy adults and that 
      aminoglycoside-O-phosphotransferases (aph3-dprime) correlated negatively with 
      total calories and soluble fiber intake. Individuals in the lowest quartile of 
      ARGs (low-ARG) consumed significantly more fiber in their diets than medium- and 
      high-ARG individuals, which was concomitant with increased abundances of obligate 
      anaerobes, especially from the family Clostridiaceae, in their gut microbiota. 
      Finally, we applied machine learning to examine 387 dietary, physiological, and 
      lifestyle features for associations with antimicrobial resistance, finding that 
      increased phylogenetic diversity of diet was associated with low-ARG individuals. 
      These data suggest diet may be a potential method for reducing the burden of AMR. 
      IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a considerable burden to 
      health care systems, with the public health community largely in consensus that 
      AMR will be a major cause of death worldwide in the coming decades. Humans carry 
      antibiotic resistance in the microbes that live in and on us, collectively known 
      as the human microbiome. Diet is a powerful method for shaping the human gut 
      microbiome and may be a tractable method for lessening antibiotic resistance, and 
      yet little is known about the relationship between diet and AMR. We examined this 
      relationship in healthy individuals who contained various abundances of 
      antibiotic resistance genes and found that individuals who consumed diverse diets 
      that were high in fiber and low in animal protein had fewer antibiotic resistance 
      genes. Dietary interventions may be useful for lessening the burden of 
      antimicrobial resistance and might ultimately motivate dietary guidelines which 
      will consider how nutrition can reduce the impact of infectious disease.

AB  - It is essential to reveal the associations between various omics data for a 
      comprehensive understanding of the altered biological process in human wellness 
      and disease. To date, very few studies have focused on collecting and exhibiting 
      multi-omics associations in a single database. Here, we present iNetModels, an 
      interactive database and visualization platform of Multi-Omics Biological 
      Networks (MOBNs). This platform describes the associations between the clinical 
      chemistry, anthropometric parameters, plasma proteomics, plasma metabolomics, as 
      well as metagenomics for oral and gut microbiome obtained from the same 
      individuals. Moreover, iNetModels includes tissue- and cancer-specific Gene 
      Co-expression Networks (GCNs) for exploring the connections between the specific 
      genes. This platform allows the user to interactively explore a single feature's 
      association with other omics data and customize its particular context (e.g. 
      male/female specific). The users can also register their data for sharing and 
      visualization of the MOBNs and GCNs. Moreover, iNetModels allows users who do not 
      have a bioinformatics background to facilitate human wellness and disease 
      research. iNetModels can be accessed freely at https://inetmodels.com without any 
      limitation.

AB  - The composition of the human gut microbiome is well resolved, but predictive 
      understanding of its dynamics is still lacking. Here, we followed a bottom-up 
      strategy to explore human gut community dynamics: we established a synthetic 
      community composed of three representative human gut isolates (Roseburia 
      intestinalis L1-82, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii A2-165 and Blautia 
      hydrogenotrophica S5a33) and explored their interactions under well-controlled 
      conditions in vitro. Systematic mono- and pair-wise fermentation experiments 
      confirmed competition for fructose and cross-feeding of formate. We quantified 
      with a mechanistic model how well tri-culture dynamics was predicted from 
      mono-culture data. With the model as reference, we demonstrated that strains 
      grown in co-culture behaved differently than those in mono-culture and confirmed 
      their altered behavior at the transcriptional level. In addition, we showed with 
      replicate tri-cultures and simulations that dominance in tri-culture sensitively 
      depends on the initial conditions. Our work has important implications for gut 
      microbial community modeling as well as for ecological interaction detection from 
      batch cultures.

TI  - Exploring Semi-Quantitative Metagenomic Studies Using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing: 
      A Computational and Experimental Protocol.
LID - 10.3390/genes12101496 [doi]
LID - 1496
AB  - The gut microbiome plays a major role in chronic diseases, of which several are 
      characterized by an altered composition and diversity of bacterial communities. 
      Large-scale sequencing projects allowed for characterizing the perturbations of 
      these communities. However, translating these discoveries into clinical 
      applications remains a challenge. To facilitate routine implementation of 
      microbiome profiling in clinical settings, portable, real-time, and low-cost 
      sequencing technologies are needed. Here, we propose a computational and 
      experimental protocol for whole-genome semi-quantitative metagenomic studies of 
      human gut microbiome with Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology (ONT) that could 
      be applied to other microbial ecosystems. We developed a bioinformatics protocol 
      to analyze ONT sequences taxonomically and functionally and optimized preanalytic 
      protocols, including stool collection and DNA extraction methods to maximize read 
      length. This is a critical parameter for the sequence alignment and 
      classification. Our protocol was evaluated using simulations of metagenomic 
      communities, which reflect naturally occurring compositional variations. Next, we 
      validated both protocols using stool samples from a bariatric surgery cohort, 
      sequenced with ONT, Illumina, and SOLiD technologies. Results revealed similar 
      diversity and microbial composition profiles. This protocol can be implemented in 
      a clinical or research setting, bringing rapid personalized whole-genome 
      profiling of target microbiome species.

TI  - Integrated Multi-Omic Analyses of the Genomic Modifications by Gut 
      Microbiome-Derived Metabolites of Epicatechin, 
      5-(4'-Hydroxyphenyl)-γ-Valerolactone, in TNFalpha-Stimulated Primary Human Brain

AB  - Cerebral blood vessels are lined with endothelial cells and form the blood-brain 
      barrier. Their dysfunction constitutes a crucial event in the physiopathology of 
      neurodegenerative disorders and cognitive impairment. Epicatechin can improve 
      cognitive functions and lower the risk for Alzheimer's disease or stroke. 
      However, molecular mechanisms of epicatechin on brain vascular endothelium are 
      still unexplored. The objective of this study was to investigate the biological 
      effects of gut microbiome-derived metabolites of epicatechin, 
      5-(4'-Hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone-3'-sulfate and 
      5-(4'-Hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone-3'-O-glucuronide, in TNF-α-stimulated human 
      brain microvascular endothelial cells at low (nM) concentrations by evaluating 
      their multi-omic modification (expression of mRNA, microRNA, long non-coding 
      RNAs, and proteins). We observed that metabolites are biologically active and can 
      simultaneously modulate the expression of protein-coding and non-coding genes as 
      well as proteins. Integrative bioinformatics analysis of obtained data revealed 
      complex networks of genomics modifications by acting at different levels of 
      regulation. Metabolites modulate cellular pathways including cell adhesion, 
      cytoskeleton organization, focal adhesion, signaling pathways, pathways 
      regulating endothelial permeability, and interaction with immune cells. This 
      study demonstrates multimodal mechanisms of action by which epicatechin 
      metabolites could preserve brain vascular endothelial cell integrity, presenting 
      mechanisms of action underlying epicatechin neuroprotective properties.

TI  - Functional Changes in the Gut Microbiome Contribute to Transforming Growth Factor 
      β-Deficient Colon Cancer.
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00065-17 [doi]
LID - e00065-17
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most treatable cancers, with a 5-year 
      survival rate of ~64%, yet over 50,000 deaths occur yearly in the United States. 
      In 15% of cases, deficiency in mismatch repair leads to null mutations in 
      transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) type II receptor, yet genotype alone is not 
      responsible for tumorigenesis. Previous work in mice shows that disruptions in 
      TGF-β signaling combined with Helicobacter hepaticus cause tumorigenesis, 
      indicating a synergistic effect between genotype and microbial environment. Here, 
      we examine functional shifts in the gut microbiome in CRC using integrated -omics 
      approaches to untangle the role of host genotype, inflammation, and microbial 
      ecology. We profile the gut microbiome of 40 mice with/without deficiency in 
      TGF-β signaling from a Smad3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homolog-3) knockout 
      and with/without inoculation with H. hepaticus. Clear functional differences in 
      the microbiome tied to specific bacterial species emerge from four pathways 
      related to human colon cancer: lipopolysaccharide (LPS) production, polyamine 
      synthesis, butyrate metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). 
      Specifically, an increase in Mucispirillum schaedleri drives LPS production, 
      which is associated with an inflammatory response. We observe a commensurate 
      decrease in butyrate production from Lachnospiraceae bacterium A4, which could 
      promote tumor formation. H. hepaticus causes an increase in OXPHOS that may 
      increase DNA-damaging free radicals. Finally, multiple bacterial species increase 
      polyamines that are associated with colon cancer, implicating not just diet but 
      also the microbiome in polyamine levels. These insights into cross talk between 
      the microbiome, host genotype, and inflammation could promote the development of 
      diagnostics and therapies for CRC. IMPORTANCE Most research on the gut microbiome 
      in colon cancer focuses on taxonomic changes at the genus level using 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing. Here, we develop a new methodology to integrate DNA and RNA data 
      sets to examine functional shifts at the species level that are important to 
      tumor development. We uncover several metabolic pathways in the microbiome that, 
      when perturbed by host genetics and H. hepaticus inoculation, contribute to colon 
      cancer. The work presented here lays a foundation for improved bioinformatics 
      methodologies to closely examine the cross talk between specific organisms and 
      the host, important for the development of diagnostics and pre/probiotic 
      treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The gut microbiome of animals is an important component that has 
      strong influence on the health, fitness, and behavior of its host. Most research 
      in the microbiome field has focused on human populations and commercially 
      important species. However, researchers are now considering the link between 
      endangered species conservation and the microbiome. In Hawai'i, several threats 
      (e.g., avian malaria and habitat loss) have caused widespread population declines 
      of Hawaiian honeycreepers (subfamily: Carduelinae). These threats can have a 
      significant effect on the avian gut microbiome and may even lead to disruption of 
      microbial function. However, the gut microbiome of honeycreeper in the wild has 
      yet to be explored. METHODS: We collected 13 and 42 fecal samples, respectively, 
      from two critically endangered honeycreeper species, the 'akikiki (Oreomystis 
      bairdi) and the 'akeke'e (Loxops caeruleirostris). The 16S rRNA gene was 
      sequenced and processed though a MOTHUR-based bioinformatics pipeline. Bacterial 
      ASVs were identified using the DADA2 program and bacterial community analyses, 
      including alpha and beta diversity measures, were conducted using R packages 
      Phyloseq and vegan. RESULTS: A total of 8,958 bacterial ASVs were identified from 
      the fecal samples. Intraspecific differences in the gut microbiome among 
      individual birds explained most of the variation present in the dataset, however 
      differences between species did exist. Both species had distinct microbiomes with 
      minimal overlap in beta diversity. 'Akikiki had a more diverse microbiome 
      compared to 'akeke'e. Additionally, small but stastically significant differences 
      in beta diversity also exist between sampling location and sexes in 'akikiki. 
      CONCLUSION: 'Akikiki and 'akeke'e are currently the focus of captive breeding 
      efforts and plans to translocate the two species to other islands are underway. 
      This baseline knowledge will help inform management decisions for these 
      honeycreeper species in their native habitats, on other islands, and in 
      captivity.

AB  - Information gathered with advanced nucleotide sequencing technologies, small 
      molecule detection systems and computational biology is revealing that a 
      community of microbes and their genes, now termed "the microbiome," located in 
      gut and rhizosphere, is responsible for maintaining the health of human beings 
      and plants, respectively. Within the complete microbiome a "core-microbiome" 
      exists that plays the pivotal role in well being of humans and plants. Recent 
      studies in medicine have shown that an artificial mixture of bacteria 
      representing the core gut microbiome of healthy person when transferred into gut 
      of diseased person results in re-establishment of normal microflora in the latter 
      leading to alleviation from diseased condition. In agriculture, though not 
      exactly in similar manner as in medicine, success in plant disease management has 
      been achieved through transfer of microbiome by mixing disease suppressive soils 
      with disease conducive soils. A study more similar to artificial gut microbiome 
      transfer in medical field has been recently reported in agriculture, in which 
      transfer of microbiome via soil solutions (filtered and unfiltered) has shown 
      ability to alleviate drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the exact 
      practice of transferring artificially cultivated core-microbiome as in medicine 
      has not thus far been attempted in plant disease management. Nonetheless, as the 
      gut and rhizosphere microbiome are known to share many common traits, there 
      exists a good scope for accomplishing similar studies in agriculture. Based upon 
      the information drawn from all recent works in microbiome studies of gut and 
      rhizosphere, we propose that tailor-made core-microbiome transfer therapy can be 
      a success in agriculture too and it could become a viable strategy for management 
      of plant diseases in future.

AB  - Honeybees (Apis mellifera) continue to succumb to human and environmental 
      pressures despite their crucial role in providing essential ecosystem services. 
      Owing to their foraging and honey production activities, honeybees form complex 
      relationships with species across all domains, such as plants, viruses, bacteria 
      and other hive pests, making honey a valuable biomonitoring tool for assessing 
      their ecological niche. Thus, the application of honey shotgun metagenomics (SM) 
      has paved the way for a detailed description of the species honeybees interact 
      with. Nevertheless, SM bioinformatics tools and DNA extraction methods rely on 
      resources not necessarily optimized for honey. In this study, we compared five 
      widely used taxonomic classifiers using simulated species communities commonly 
      found in honey. We found that Kraken 2 with a threshold of 0.5 performs best in 
      assessing species distribution. We also optimized a simple NaOH-based honey DNA 
      extraction methodology (Direct-SM), which profiled species seasonal variability 
      similarly to an established column-based DNA extraction approach (SM). Both 
      approaches produce results consistent with melissopalinology analysis describing 
      the botanical landscape surrounding the apiary. Interestingly, we detected a 
      strong stability of the bacteria constituting the core and noncore gut microbiome 
      across seasons, pointing to the potential utility of honey for noninvasive 
      assessment of bee microbiota. Finally, the Direct-SM approach to detect Varroa 
      correlates well with the biomonitoring of mite infestation observed in hives. 
      These observations suggest that Direct-SM methodology has the potential to 
      comprehensively describe honeybee ecological niches and can be tested as a 
      building block for large-scale studies to assess bee health in the field.

AB  - Human gut microbiome structure and emergent metabolic outputs impact health 
      outcomes. However, what drives such community characteristics remains 
      underexplored. Here, we rely on high throughput genomic reconstruction modeling, 
      to infer the metabolic attributes and nutritional requirements of 816 gut 
      strains, via a framework termed GEMNAST. This has been performed in terms of a 
      group of human vitamins to examine the role vitamin exchanges have at different 
      levels of community organization. We find that only 91 strains can satisfy their 
      vitamin requirements (prototrophs) while the rest show various degrees of 
      auxotrophy/specialization, highlighting their dependence on external sources, 
      such as other members of the microbial community. Further, 79% of the strains in 
      our sample were mapped to 11 distinct vitamin requirement profiles with low 
      phylogenetic consistency. Yet, we find that human gut microbial community 
      enterotype indicators display marked metabolic differences. Prevotella strains 
      display a metabolic profile that can be complemented by strains from other genera 
      often associated with the Prevotella enterotype and agrarian diets, while 
      Bacteroides strains occupy a prototrophic profile. Finally, we identify 
      pre-defined interaction modules (IMs) of gut species from human and mice 
      predicted to be driven by, or highly independent of vitamin exchanges. Our 
      analysis provides mechanistic grounding to gut microbiome stability and to 
      co-abundance-based observations, a fundamental step toward understanding emergent 
      processes that influence health outcomes. Further, our work opens a path to 
      future explorations in the field through applications of GEMNAST to additional 
      nutritional dimensions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the formation and progression 
      of colorectal cancer (CRC). To better identify the underlying gene-level 
      pathogenic mechanisms of microbiome-associated CRC, we applied our newly 
      developed Reverse Microbiomics (RM) to predict potential pathogenic factors using 
      the data of microbiomes in CRC patients. RESULTS: Our literature search first 
      identified 40 bacterial species enriched and 23 species depleted in the guts of 
      CRC patients. These bacteria were systematically modeled and analyzed using the 
      NCBI Taxonomy ontology. Ten species, including 6 enriched species (e.g., 
      Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Streptococcus equinus) and 4 
      depleted species (e.g., Bacteroides uniformis and Streptococcus thermophilus) 
      were chosen for follow-up comparative genomics analysis. Vaxign was used to 
      comparatively analyze 47 genome sequences of these ten species. In total 18 
      autoantigens were predicted to contribute to CRC formation, six of which were 
      reported with experimental evidence to be correlated with drug resistance and/or 
      cell invasiveness of CRC. Interestingly, four human homology proteins 
      (EDK89078.1, EDK87700.1, EDK89777.1, and EDK89145.1) are conserved among all 
      enriched strains. Furthermore, we predicted 76 potential virulence factors 
      without homology to human proteins, including two riboflavin synthase proteins, 
      three ATP-binding cassettes (ABC) transporter protein family proteins, and 12 
      outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Riboflavin synthase is present in all the 
      enriched strains but not in depleted species. The critical role of riboflavin 
      synthase in CRC development was further identified from its hub role in our 
      STRING-based protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and from the 
      finding of the riboflavin metabolism as the most significantly enriched pathway 
      in our KEGG pathway analysis. A novel model of the CRC pathogenesis involving 
      riboflavin synthase and other related proteins including TpiA and GrxC was 
      further proposed. CONCLUSIONS: The RM strategy was used to predict 18 
      autoantigens and 76 potential virulence factors from CRC-associated microbiome 
      data. In addition to many of these autoantigens and virulence factors 
      experimentally verified as reported in the literature, our study predicted many 
      new pathogenetic factors and developed a new model of CRC pathogenesis involving 
      the riboflavin synthase from the enriched colorectal bacteria and other 
      associated proteins.

AB  - A variety of autoimmune and allergy events are becoming increasingly common, 
      especially in Western countries. Some pieces of research link such conditions 
      with the composition of microbiota during infancy. In this period, the 
      predominant form of nutrition for gut microbiota is oligosaccharides from human 
      milk (HMO). A number of gut-colonizing strains, such as Bifidobacterium and 
      Bacteroides, are able to utilize HMO, but only some Bifidobacterium strains have 
      evolved to digest the specific composition of human oligosaccharides. Differences 
      in the proportions of the two genera that are able to utilize HMO have already 
      been associated with the frequency of allergies and autoimmune diseases in the 
      Finnish and the Russian populations. Our results show that differences in terms 
      of the taxonomic annotation do not explain the reason for the differences in the 
      Bifidobacterium/Bacteroides ratio between the Finnish and the Russian 
      populations. In this paper, we present the results of function-level analysis. 
      Unlike the typical workflow for gene abundance analysis, BiomeScout technology 
      explains the differences in the Bifidobacterium/Bacteroides ratio. Our research 
      shows the differences in the abundances of the two enzymes that are crucial for 
      the utilization of short type 1 oligosaccharides.IMPORTANCE Knowing the 
      limitations of taxonomy-based research, there is an emerging need for the 
      development of higher-resolution techniques. The significance of this research is 
      demonstrated by the novel method used for the analysis of function-level 
      metagenomes. BiomeScout-the presented technology-utilizes proprietary algorithms 
      for the detection of differences between functionalities present in metagenomic 
      samples.

AB  - The human gut harbors thousands of bacterial taxa. A profusion of metagenomic 
      sequence data has been generated from human stool samples in the last few years, 
      raising the question of whether more taxa remain to be identified. We assessed 
      metagenomic data generated by the Human Microbiome Project Consortium to 
      determine if novel taxa remain to be discovered in stool samples from healthy 
      individuals. To do this, we established a rigorous bioinformatics pipeline that 
      uses sequence data from multiple platforms (Illumina GAIIX and Roche 454 FLX 
      Titanium) and approaches (whole-genome shotgun and 16S rDNA amplicons) to 
      validate novel taxa. We applied this approach to stool samples from 11 healthy 
      subjects collected as part of the Human Microbiome Project. We discovered several 
      low-abundance, novel bacterial taxa, which span three major phyla in the 
      bacterial tree of life. We determined that these taxa are present in a larger set 
      of Human Microbiome Project subjects and are found in two sampling sites (Houston 
      and St. Louis). We show that the number of false-positive novel sequences 
      (primarily chimeric sequences) would have been two orders of magnitude higher 
      than the true number of novel taxa without validation using multiple datasets, 
      highlighting the importance of establishing rigorous standards for the 
      identification of novel taxa in metagenomic data. The majority of novel sequences 
      are related to the recently discovered genus Barnesiella, further encouraging 
      efforts to characterize the members of this genus and to study their roles in the 
      microbial communities of the gut. A better understanding of the effects of 
      less-abundant bacteria is important as we seek to understand the complex gut 
      microbiome in healthy individuals and link changes in the microbiome to disease.

TI  - Metagenome-wide association study of gut microbiome revealed potential microbial 
      marker set for diagnosis of pediatric myasthenia gravis.
PG  - 159

AB  - BACKGROUND: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired immune-mediated disorder of the 
      neuromuscular junction that causes fluctuating skeletal muscle weakness and 
      fatigue. Pediatric MG and adult MG have many different characteristics, and 
      current MG diagnostic methods for children are not quite fit. Previous studies 
      indicate that alterations in the gut microbiota may be associated with adult MG. 
      However, it has not been determined whether the gut microbiota are altered in 
      pediatric MG patients. METHODS: Our study recruited 53 pediatric MG patients and 
      46 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). We sequenced the fecal samples 
      of recruited individuals using whole-genome shotgun sequencing and analyzed the 
      data with in-house bioinformatics pipeline. RESULTS: We built an MG disease 
      classifier based on the abundance of five species, Fusobacterium mortiferum, 
      Prevotella stercorea, Prevotella copri, Megamonas funiformis, and Megamonas 
      hypermegale. The classifier obtained 94% area under the curve (AUC) in 
      cross-validation and 84% AUC in the independent validation cohort. Gut microbiome 
      analysis revealed the presence of human adenovirus F/D in 10 MG patients. 
      Significantly different pathways and gene families between MG patients and HC 
      belonged to P. copri, Clostridium bartlettii, and Bacteroides massiliensis. Based 
      on functional annotation, we found that the gut microbiome affects the production 
      of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and we confirmed the decrease in SCFA levels 
      in pediatric MG patients via serum tests. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that 
      altered fecal microbiota might play vital roles in pediatric MG's pathogenesis by 
      reducing SCFAs. The microbial markers might serve as novel diagnostic methods for 
      pediatric MG.

AB  - The microbial cells colonizing the human body form an ecosystem that is integral 
      to the regulation and maintenance of human health. Elucidation of specific 
      associations between the human microbiome and health outcomes is facilitating the 
      development of microbiome-targeted recommendations and treatments (e.g., fecal 
      microbiota transplant; pre-, pro-, and post-biotics) to help prevent and treat 
      disease. However, the potential of such recommendations and treatments to improve 
      human health has yet to be fully realized. Technological advances have led to the 
      development and proliferation of a wide range of tools and methods to collect, 
      store, sequence, and analyze microbiome samples. However, differences in 
      methodology at each step in these analytic processes can lead to variability in 
      results due to the unique biases and limitations of each component. This 
      technical variability hampers the detection and validation of associations with 
      small to medium effect sizes. Therefore, the American Society for Nutrition (ASN) 
      Nutritional Microbiology Group Engaging Members (GEM), sponsored by the Institute 
      for the Advancement of Food and Nutrition Sciences (IAFNS), hosted a satellite 
      session on methods in nutrition and gut microbiome research to review currently 
      available methods for microbiome research, best practices, as well as tools and 
      standards to aid in comparability of methods and results. This manuscript 
      summarizes the topics and research discussed at the session. Consideration of the 
      guidelines and principles reviewed in this session will increase the accuracy, 
      precision, and comparability of microbiome research and ultimately the 
      understanding of the associations between the human microbiome and health.

TI  - Sparse least trimmed squares regression with compositional covariates for 
      high-dimensional data.
PG  - 3805-3814
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btab572 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing technologies generate a huge amount of 
      data, permitting the quantification of microbiome compositions. The obtained data 
      are essentially sparse compositional data vectors, namely vectors of bacterial 
      gene proportions which compose the microbiome. Subsequently, the need for 
      statistical and computational methods that consider the special nature of 
      microbiome data has increased. A critical aspect in microbiome research is to 
      identify microbes associated with a clinical outcome. Another crucial aspect with 
      high-dimensional data is the detection of outlying observations, whose presence 
      affects seriously the prediction accuracy. RESULTS: In this article, we connect 
      robustness and sparsity in the context of variable selection in regression with 
      compositional covariates with a continuous response. The compositional character 
      of the covariates is taken into account by a linear log-contrast model, and 
      elastic-net regularization achieves sparsity in the regression coefficient 
      estimates. Robustness is obtained by performing trimming in the objective 
      function of the estimator. A reweighting step increases the efficiency of the 
      estimator, and it also allows for diagnostics in terms of outlier identification. 
      The numerical performance of the proposed method is evaluated via simulation 
      studies, and its usefulness is illustrated by an application to a microbiome 
      study with the aim to predict caffeine intake based on the human gut microbiome 
      composition. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The R-package 'RobZS' can be

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet and particularly dietary fibres have an impact on the gut 
      microbiome and play an important role in human health and disease. Pectin is a 
      highly consumed dietary fibre found in fruits and vegetables and is also a widely 
      used additive in the food industry. Yet there is no information on the effect of 
      pectin on the human gut microbiome. Likewise, little is known on gut pectinolytic 
      bacteria and their enzyme systems. This study was undertaken to investigate the 
      mechanisms of pectin degradation by the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides 
      xylanisolvens. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analyses of B. xylanisolvens XB1A grown on 
      citrus and apple pectins at mid- and late-log phases highlighted six 
      polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) that were overexpressed on pectin relative 
      to glucose. The PUL numbers used in this report are those given by Terrapon et 
      al. (Bioinformatics 31(5):647-55, 2015) and found in the PUL database: 
      http://www.cazy.org/PULDB/. Based on their CAZyme composition, we propose that 
      PUL 49 and 50, the most overexpressed PULs on both pectins and at both growth 
      phases, are involved in homogalacturonan (HG) and type I rhamnogalacturonan (RGI) 
      degradation, respectively. PUL 13 and PUL 2 could be involved in the degradation 
      of arabinose-containing side chains and of type II rhamnogalacturonan (RGII), 
      respectively. Considering that HG is the most abundant moiety (>70%) within 
      pectin, the importance of PUL 49 was further investigated by insertion 
      mutagenesis into the susC-like gene. The insertion blocked transcription of the 
      susC-like and the two downstream genes (susD-like/FnIII). The mutant showed 
      strong growth reduction, thus confirming that PUL 49 plays a major role in pectin 
      degradation. CONCLUSION: This study shows the existence of six PULs devoted to 
      pectin degradation by B. xylanisolvens, one of them being particularly important 
      in this function. Hence, this species deploys a very complex enzymatic machinery 
      that probably reflects the structural complexity of pectin. Our findings also 
      highlight the metabolic plasticity of B. xylanisolvens towards dietary fibres 
      that contributes to its competitive fitness within the human gut ecosystem. Wider 
      functional and ecological studies are needed to understand how dietary fibers and 
      especially plant cell wall polysaccharides drive the composition and metabolism 
      of the fibrolytic and non-fibrolytic community within the gut microbial 
      ecosystem.

TI  - Iron Deficiency Modulates Metabolic Landscape of Bacteroidetes Promoting Its

AB  - Bacteria have to persist under low iron conditions in order to adapt to the 
      nutritional immunity of a host. Since the knowledge of iron stimulon of 
      Bacteroidetes is sparse, we examined oral (Porphyromonas gingivalis and 
      Prevotella intermedia) and gut (Bacteroides thataiotaomicron) representatives for 
      their ability to adapt to iron deplete and iron replete conditions. Our 
      transcriptomics and comparative genomics analysis show that many iron-regulated 
      mechanisms are conserved within the phylum. They include genes upregulated in low 
      iron, as follows: fldA (flavodoxin), hmu (hemin uptake operon), and loci encoding 
      ABC transporters. Downregulated genes were frd (ferredoxin), rbr (rubrerythrin), 
      sdh (succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase), vor (oxoglutarate 
      oxidoreductase/dehydrogenase), and pfor (pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin 
      oxidoreductase). Some genus-specific mechanisms, such as the sus of B. 
      thetaiotaomicron coding for carbohydrate metabolism and the xusABC coding for 
      xenosiderophore utilization were also identified. While all bacteria tested in 
      our study had the nrfAH operon coding for nitrite reduction and were able to 
      reduce nitrite levels present in culture media, the expression of the operon was 
      iron dependent only in B. thetaiotaomicron. It is noteworthy that we identified a 
      significant overlap between regulated genes found in our study and the B. 
      thetaiotaomicron colitis study (W. Zhu, M. G. Winter, L. Spiga, E. R. Hughes et 
      al., Cell Host Microbe 27:376-388, 2020, 
      http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.01.010). Many of those commonly regulated 
      genes were also iron regulated in the oral bacterial genera. Overall, this work 
      points to iron being the master regulator enabling bacterial persistence in the 
      host and paves the way for a more generalized investigation of the molecular 
      mechanisms of iron homeostasis in Bacteroidetes. IMPORTANCE Bacteroidetes are an 
      important group of anaerobic bacteria abundant both in the oral and gut 
      microbiomes. Although iron is a required nutrient for most living organisms, the 
      molecular mechanisms of adaptation to the changing levels of iron are not well 
      known in this group of bacteria. We defined the iron stimulon of Bacteroidetes by 
      examination of the transcriptomic response of Porphyromonas gingivalis and 
      Prevotella intermedia (both belong to the oral microbiome) and Bacteroidetes 
      thetaiotaomicron (belongs to the gut microbiome). Our results indicate that many 
      of the iron-regulated operons are shared among the three genera. Furthermore, 
      using bioinformatics analysis, we identified a significant overlap between our in 
      vitro studies and transcriptomic data derived from a colitis study, thus 
      underscoring the biological significance of our work. Defining the iron-dependent 
      stimulon of Bacteroidetes can help to identify the molecular mechanisms of 
      iron-dependent regulation as well as better understand the persistence of the 
      anaerobes in the human host.

AB  - Human gut microbiome dysbiosis has been associated with the onset of metabolic 
      diseases and disorders. However, the critical factors leading to dysbiosis are 
      poorly understood. In this study, we provide increasing evidence of the 
      association of diet type and body mass index (BMI) and how they relatively 
      influence the taxonomic structure of the gut microbiota with respect to the 
      causation of gut microbiome dysbiosis. The study included randomly selected 
      Alabama residents (n = 81), including females (n = 45) and males (n = 36). The 
      demographics data included age (33 ± 13.3 years), height (1.7 ± 0.11 meters), and 
      weight (82.3 ± 20.6 kg). The mean BMI was 28.3 ± 7.01, equating to an overweight 
      BMI category. A cross-sectional case-control design encompassing the newly 
      recognized effect size approach to bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze 
      data from donated stool samples and accompanying nutrition surveys. We 
      investigated the microbiome variations in the Bacteroidetes-Firmicutes ratio 
      relative to BMI, food categories, and dietary groups at stratified abundance 
      percentages of <20%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and ≥70%. We further investigated 
      variation in the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla composition (at the genus and 
      species level) in relation to BMI, food categories, and dietary groups 
      (Westernized or healthy). The Pearson Correlation coefficient as an indication of 
      effect size across Alpha diversity indices was used to test the hypothesis (H(0) 
      ): increased BMI has greater effect on taxonomic diversity than Westernized diet 
      type, (H(a) ): increased BMI does not have a greater effect on taxonomic 
      diversity than Westernized diet type. In conclusion, we rejected the (H(0) ) as 
      our results demonstrated that Westernized diet type had an effect size of 0.22

      Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients.

AB  - Alterations in the gut microbiome have been associated with various human 
      diseases. Most existing gut microbiome studies stopped at the stage of 
      identifying microbial alterations between diseased or healthy conditions. As 
      inspired by reverse vaccinology (RV), we developed a new strategy called Reverse 
      Microbiomics (RM) that turns this process around: based on the identified 
      microbial alternations, reverse-predicting the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      the disease and microbial alternations. Our RM methodology starts by identifying 
      significantly altered microbiota profiles, performing bioinformatics analysis on 
      the proteomes of the microbiota identified, and finally predicting potential 
      virulence or protective factors relevant to a microbiome-associated disease. As a 
      use case study, this reverse methodology was applied to study the molecular 
      pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a common autoimmune and inflammatory 
      disease. Those bacteria differentially associated with RA were first identified 
      and annotated from published data and then modeled and classified using the 
      Ontology of Host-Microbiome Interactions (OHMI). Our study identified 14 species 
      increased and 9 species depleted in the gut microbiota of RA patients. Vaxign was 
      used to comparatively analyze 15 genome sequences of the two pairs of species: 
      Gram-negative Prevotella copri (increased) and Prevotella histicola (depleted), 
      as well as Gram-positive Bifidobacterium dentium (increased) and Bifidobacterium 
      bifidum (depleted). In total, 21 auto-antigens were predicted to be related to 
      RA, and five of them were previously reported to be associated with RA with 
      experimental evidence. Furthermore, we identified 94 potential adhesive virulence 
      factors including 24 microbial ABC transporters. While eukaryotic ABC 
      transporters are key RA diagnosis markers and drug targets, we identified, for 
      the first-time, RA-associated microbial ABC transporters and provided a novel 
      hypothesis of RA pathogenesis. Our study showed that RM, by broadening the scope 
      of RV, is a novel and effective strategy to study from bacterial level to 
      molecular level factors and gain further insight into how these factors possibly 
      contribute to the development of microbial alterations under specific diseases.

AB  - Characterizing the gut microbiota in terms of their capacity to interfere with 
      drug metabolism is necessary to achieve drug efficacy and safety. Although 
      examples of drug-microbiome interactions are well-documented, little has been 
      reported about a computational pipeline for systematically identifying and 
      characterizing bacterial enzymes that process particular classes of drugs. The 
      goal of our study is to develop a computational approach that compiles drugs 
      whose metabolism may be influenced by a particular class of microbial enzymes and 
      that quantifies the variability in the collective level of those enzymes among 
      individuals. The present paper describes this approach, with microbial 
      β-glucuronidases as an example, which break down drug-glucuronide conjugates and 
      reactivate the drugs or their metabolites. We identified 100 medications that may 
      be metabolized by β-glucuronidases from the gut microbiome. These medications 
      included morphine, estrogen, ibuprofen, midazolam, and their structural 
      analogues. The analysis of metagenomic data available through the Sequence Read 
      Archive (SRA) showed that the level of β-glucuronidase in the gut metagenomes was 
      higher in males than in females, which provides a potential explanation for the 
      sex-based differences in efficacy and toxicity for several drugs, reported in 
      previous studies. Our analysis also showed that infant gut metagenomes at birth 
      and 12 months of age have higher levels of β-glucuronidase than the metagenomes 
      of their mothers and the implication of this observed variability was discussed 
      in the context of breastfeeding as well as infant hyperbilirubinemia. Overall, 
      despite important limitations discussed in this paper, our analysis provided 
      useful insights on the role of the human gut metagenome in the variability in 
      drug response among individuals. Importantly, this approach exploits drug and 
      metagenome data available in public databases as well as open-source 
      cheminformatics and bioinformatics tools to predict drug-metagenome interactions.

AB  - Interaction between disease-microbiome associations and ageing has not been 
      explored in detail. Here, using age/region-matched sub-sets, we analysed the gut 
      microbiome differences across five major diseases in a multi-cohort dataset 
      constituting more than 2500 individuals from 20 to 89 years old. We show that 
      disease-microbiome associations display specific age-centric trends. 
      Ageing-associated microbiome alterations towards a disease-like configuration 
      occur in colorectal cancer patients, thereby masking disease signatures. We 
      identified a microbiome disease response shared across multiple diseases in 
      elderly subjects that is distinct from that in young/middle-aged individuals, but 
      also a novel set of taxa consistently gained in disease across all age groups. A 
      subset of these taxa was associated with increased frailty in subjects from the 
      ELDERMET cohort. The relevant taxa differentially encode specific functions that 
      are known to have disease associations.

OAB - The human body is an ecosystem made up of both human cells and trillions of 
      microbes, and the largest microbial community is in the gut. This community of 
      gut microbes helps harvest nutrients from our food, modulates our immune system, 
      and even affects our mood. Infectious and chronic diseases appear to cause 
      changes in the make-up of the gut microbiome, while microbiome changes may 
      increase the risk of some non-infectious diseases. Learning more about these 
      disease-linked changes in the gut microbiome may therefore help scientists to 
      develop new tests and treatments. To do this, scientists need to understand which 
      microbes play a role in individual diseases, if risk-related microbes are gained 
      or helpful microbes lost in patients with particular diseases, and if certain 
      changes in gut microbes occur across many diseases. Ageing also changes the gut 
      microbes. This may happen because older individuals eat a less complex diet and 
      are likely to take many medications that may alter the microbes in their gut. 
      Because of this, age may affect changes in gut microbes associated with diseases. 
      This highlights the need for studies that tease apart the importance of 
      ageing-related and disease-related changes in the gut microbiome. Now, Ghosh et 
      al. show that gut microbe changes linked to diseases may vary with a person’s 
      age. The analysis compared the gut microbiomes of more than 2,500 individuals 
      aged 20 to 89. This included individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, 
      colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes, intestinal polyps and liver cirrhosis. The 
      study revealed that younger people gradually gain disease-associated gut 
      microbes, while older people tend to lose the gut microbes usually found in a 
      healthy gut. Ghosh et al. also identified a set of gut microbes that were gained 
      in many diseases and across age-groups. This set of microbes was also associated 
      with frailty in elderly people. The characteristics of the microbes in this set 
      are all known to have detrimental effects on human health. This analysis shows 
      how important it is to control for age and other factors that may skew the 
      results of microbiome projects. Future studies are needed to understand why these 
      gut microbe changes occur and what the consequences of these changes are for a 
      person’s health and the course of their disease. This may lead to the development 
      of treatment strategies that help promote a healthy gut microbiome and fight 
      disease throughout life.

AB  - MOTIVATION: Carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are extremely important to 
      bioenergy, human gut microbiome, and plant pathogen researches and industries. 
      Here we developed a new amino acid k-mer-based CAZyme classification, motif 
      identification and genome annotation tool using a bipartite network algorithm. 
      Using this tool, we classified 390 CAZyme families into thousands of subfamilies 
      each with distinguishing k-mer peptides. These k-mers represented the 
      characteristic motifs (in the form of a collection of conserved short peptides) 
      of each subfamily, and thus were further used to annotate new genomes for 
      CAZymes. This idea was also generalized to extract characteristic k-mer peptides 
      for all the Swiss-Prot enzymes classified by the EC (enzyme commission) numbers 
      and applied to enzyme EC prediction. RESULTS: This new tool was implemented as a 
      Python package named eCAMI. Benchmark analysis of eCAMI against the 
      state-of-the-art tools on CAZyme and enzyme EC datasets found that: (i) eCAMI has 
      the best performance in terms of accuracy and memory use for CAZyme and enzyme EC 
      classification and annotation; (ii) the k-mer-based tools (including PPR-Hotpep, 
      CUPP and eCAMI) perform better than homology-based tools and deep-learning tools 
      in enzyme EC prediction. Lastly, we confirmed that the k-mer-based tools have the 
      unique ability to identify the characteristic k-mer peptides in the predicted 
      enzymes. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://github.com/yinlabniu/eCAMI and 
      https://github.com/zhanglabNKU/eCAMI. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary 
      data are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Braak's hypothesis states that sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      follows a specific progression of pathology from the peripheral to the central 
      nervous system, and this progression can be monitored by detecting 
      the accumulation of alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) protein. Consequently, there 
      is growing interest in understanding how the gut (commensal) microbiome can 
      regulate α-Syn accumulation, as this could potentially lead to PD. METHODS: We 
      used 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing to characterise microbial diversity. 
      (1)H-NMR was employed to understand the metabolite production and intestinal 
      inflammation estimated using ELISA and RNA-sequencing from feces and 
      the intestinal epithelial layer respectively. The Na(+) channel current and gut 
      permeability were measured using an Ussing chamber. Immunohistochemistry and 
      immunofluorescence imaging were applied to detect the α-Syn protein. LC-MS/MS was 
      used for characterization of proteins from metabolite treated neuronal cells. 
      Finally, Metascape and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) bioinformatics tools were 
      used for identification of dysregulated pathways. RESULTS: We studied a 
      transgenic (TG) rat model overexpressing the human SNCA gene and found that a 
      progressive gut microbial composition alteration characterized by the reduction 
      of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio could be detected in the young TG rats. 
      Interestingly, this ratio then increased with ageing. The dynamics of 
      Lactobacillus and Alistipes were monitored and reduced Lactobacillus and 
      increased Alistipes abundance was discerned in ageing TG rats. Additionally, the 
      SNCA gene overexpression resulted in gut α-Syn protein expression and increased 
      with advanced age. Further, older TG animals had increased intestinal 
      inflammation, decreased Na(+) current and a robust alteration in metabolite 
      production characterized by the increase of succinate levels in feces and serum. 
      Manipulation of the gut bacteria by short-term antibiotic cocktail treatment 
      revealed a complete loss of short-chain fatty acids and a reduction in succinate 
      levels. Although antibiotic cocktail treatment did not change α-Syn expression in 
      the enteric nervous system of the colon, however, reduced α-Syn expression was 
      detected in the olfactory bulbs (forebrain) of the TG rats. CONCLUSION: Our data 
      emphasize that the gut microbiome dysbiosis synchronous with ageing leads to a 
      specific alteration of gut metabolites and can be modulated by antibiotics which 
      may affect PD pathology.

AB  - Glyphosate is the most common broad-spectrum herbicide. It targets the key enzyme 
      of the shikimate pathway, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), 
      which synthesizes three essential aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine 
      and tryptophan) in plants. Because the shikimate pathway is also found in many 
      prokaryotes and fungi, the widespread use of glyphosate may have unsuspected 
      impacts on the diversity and composition of microbial communities, including the 
      human gut microbiome. Here, we introduce the first bioinformatics method to 
      assess the potential sensitivity of organisms to glyphosate based on the type of 
      EPSPS enzyme. We have precomputed a dataset of EPSPS sequences from thousands of 
      species that will be an invaluable resource to advancing the research field. This 
      novel methodology can classify sequences from nearly 90% of eukaryotes and >80% 
      of prokaryotes. A conservative estimate from our results shows that 54% of 
      species in the core human gut microbiome are sensitive to glyphosate.

TI  - Discovery of novel community-relevant small proteins in a simplified human 
      intestinal microbiome.
PG  - 55

LID - 55
AB  - BACKGROUND: The intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in protecting the host 
      from pathogenic microbes, modulating immunity and regulating metabolic processes. 
      We studied the simplified human intestinal microbiota (SIHUMIx) consisting of 
      eight bacterial species with a particular focus on the discovery of novel small 
      proteins with less than 100 amino acids (= sProteins), some of which may 
      contribute to shape the simplified human intestinal microbiota. Although 
      sProteins carry out a wide range of important functions, they are still often 
      missed in genome annotations, and little is known about their structure and 
      function in individual microbes and especially in microbial communities. RESULTS: 
      We created a multi-species integrated proteogenomics search database (iPtgxDB) to 
      enable a comprehensive identification of novel sProteins. Six of the eight 
      SIHUMIx species, for which no complete genomes were available, were sequenced and 
      de novo assembled. Several proteomics approaches including two earlier optimized 
      sProtein enrichment strategies were applied to specifically increase the chances 
      for novel sProtein discovery. The search of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data 
      against the multi-species iPtgxDB enabled the identification of 31 novel 
      sProteins, of which the expression of 30 was supported by metatranscriptomics 
      data. Using synthetic peptides, we were able to validate the expression of 25 
      novel sProteins. The comparison of sProtein expression in each single strain 
      versus a multi-species community cultivation showed that six of these sProteins 
      were only identified in the SIHUMIx community indicating a potentially important 
      role of sProteins in the organization of microbial communities. Two of these 
      novel sProteins have a potential antimicrobial function. Metabolic modelling 
      revealed that a third sProtein is located in a genomic region encoding several 
      enzymes relevant for the community metabolism within SIHUMIx. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      outline an integrated experimental and bioinformatics workflow for the discovery 
      of novel sProteins in a simplified intestinal model system that can be 
      generically applied to other microbial communities. The further analysis of novel 
      sProteins uniquely expressed in the SIHUMIx multi-species community is expected 
      to enable new insights into the role of sProteins on the functionality of 
      bacterial communities such as those of the human intestinal tract. Video

AB  - The studies of microbial communities have drawn increased attention in various 
      research fields such as agriculture, environment, and human health. Recently, 
      metaproteomics has become a powerful tool to interpret the roles of the community 
      members by investigating the expressed proteins of the microbes. However, 
      analyzing the metaproteomic data sets at genome resolution is still challenging 
      because of the lack of efficient bioinformatics tools. Here we develop 
      MetaLab-MAG, a specially designed tool for the characterization of microbiomes 
      from metagenome-assembled genomes databases. MetaLab-MAG was evaluated by 
      analyzing various human gut microbiota data sets and performed comparably or 
      better than searching the gene catalog protein database directly. MetaLab-MAG can 
      quantify the genome-level microbiota compositions and supports both label-free 
      and isobaric labeling-based quantification strategies. MetaLab-MAG removes the 
      obstacles of metaproteomic data analysis and provides the researchers with 
      in-depth and comprehensive information from the microbiomes.

TI  - Enabling large-scale next-generation sequence assembly with Blacklight.
PG  - 2157-2166
AB  - A variety of extremely challenging biological sequence analyses were conducted on 
      the XSEDE large shared memory resource Blacklight, using current bioinformatics 
      tools and encompassing a wide range of scientific applications. These include 
      genomic sequence assembly, very large metagenomic sequence assembly, 
      transcriptome assembly, and sequencing error correction. The data sets used in 
      these analyses included uncategorized fungal species, reference microbial data, 
      very large soil and human gut microbiome sequence data, and primate 
      transcriptomes, composed of both short-read and long-read sequence data. A new 
      parallel command execution program was developed on the Blacklight resource to 
      handle some of these analyses. These results, initially reported previously at 
      XSEDE13 and expanded here, represent significant advances for their respective 
      scientific communities. The breadth and depth of the results achieved demonstrate 
      the ease of use, versatility, and unique capabilities of the Blacklight XSEDE 
      resource for scientific analysis of genomic and transcriptomic sequence data, and 
      the power of these resources, together with XSEDE support, in meeting the most 
      challenging scientific problems.

AB  - Scientific studies focused on the role of the human microbiome over human health 
      have generated billions of gigabits of genetic information during the last 
      decade. Nowadays integration of all this information in public databases and 
      development of pipelines allowing us to biotechnologically exploit this 
      information are urgently needed. Prediction of the potential bioactivity of the 
      products encoded by the human gut microbiome, or metaproteome, is the first step 
      for identifying proteins responsible for the molecular interaction between 
      microorganisms and the immune system. We have recently published the Mechanism of 
      Action of the Human Microbiome (MAHMI) database (http://www.mahmi.org), conceived 
      as a resource compiling peptide sequences with a potential immunomodulatory 
      activity. Fifteen out of the 300 hundred million peptides contained in the MAHMI 
      database were synthesized. These peptides were identified as being encrypted in 
      proteins produced by gut microbiota members, they do not contain cleavage points 
      for the major intestinal endoproteases and displayed high probability to have 
      immunomodulatory bioactivity. The bacterial peptides FR-16 and LR-17 encrypted in 
      proteins from Bifidobacterium longum DJ010A and Bifidobacterium fragilis YCH46 
      respectively, showed the higher immune modulation capability over human 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Both peptides modulated the immune response 
      toward increases in the Th17 and decreases in the Th1 cell response, together 
      with an induction of IL-22 production. These results strongly suggest the 
      combined use of bioinformatics and in vitro tools as a first stage in the 
      screening of bioactive peptides encrypted in the human gut metaproteome.

TI  - HIV-Positive Patients on Antiretroviral Therapy Have an Altered Mucosal 
      Intestinal but Not Oral Microbiome.
PG  - e0247222

AB  - This study characterized compositional and functional shifts in the intestinal 
      and oral microbiome in HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy compared 
      to HIV-negative individuals. Seventy-nine specimens were collected from 5 
      HIV-positive and 12 control subjects from five locations (colon brush, colon 
      wash, terminal ileum [TI] brush, TI wash, and saliva) during colonoscopy and at 
      patient visits. Microbiome composition was characterized using 16S rRNA 
      sequencing, and microbiome function was predicted using bioinformatics tools 
      (PICRUSt and BugBase). Our analysis indicated that the β-diversity of all 
      intestinal samples (colon brush, colon wash, TI brush, and TI wash) from patients 
      with HIV was significantly different from patients without HIV. Specifically, 
      bacteria from genera Prevotella, Fusobacterium, and Megasphaera were more 
      abundant in samples from HIV-positive patients. On the other hand, bacteria from 
      genera Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Clostridium were more abundant in samples from 
      HIV-negative patients. Additionally, HIV-positive patients had higher abundances 
      of biofilm-forming and pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, pathways related to 
      translation and nucleotide metabolism were elevated in HIV-positive patients, 
      whereas pathways related to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were positively 
      correlated with samples from HIV-negative patients. Our analyses further showed 
      variations in microbiome composition in HIV-positive and negative patients by 
      sampling site. Samples from colon wash, colon brush, and TI wash were significant 
      between groups, while samples from TI brush and saliva were not significant. 
      Taken together, here, we report altered intestinal microbiome composition and 
      predicted function in patients with HIV compared to uninfected patients, though 
      we found no changes in the oral microbiome. IMPORTANCE Over 37 million people 
      worldwide are living with HIV. Although the availability of antiretroviral 
      therapy has significantly reduced the number of AIDS-related deaths, individuals 
      living with HIV are at increased risk for opportunistic infections. We now know 
      that HIV interacts with the trillions of bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the 
      human body termed the microbiome. Only a limited number of previous studies have 
      compared variations in the oral and gastrointestinal microbiome with HIV 
      infection. Here, we detail how the oral and gastrointestinal microbiome changes 
      with HIV infection, having used 5 different sampling sites to gain a more 
      comprehensive view of these changes by location. Our results show site-specific 
      changes in the intestinal microbiome associated with HIV infection. Additionally, 
      we show that while there were significant changes in the intestinal microbiome, 
      there were no significant changes in the oral microbiome.

TI  - The fermented soy beverage Q-CAN® plus induces beneficial changes in the oral and 
      intestinal microbiome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soy products are associated with many beneficial health consequences, 
      but their effects on the human intestinal microbiome are poorly characterized. 
      OBJECTIVES: To identify the changes in the oral and fecal microbiome in lean and 
      obese participants due to consumption of Q-CAN®, and to assess the expected 
      consequences of these changes based on the published literature. METHODS: 
      Prospective study of lean (10) and obese (9) participants consuming Q-CAN® twice 
      daily for 4 weeks with 8 weeks follow-up. Microbial DNA was extracted from saliva 
      and stool samples, amplified against the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
      and data analyzed using QIIME 1.9.1 bioinformatics. Four hundred forty-four 
      samples were collected in total, 424 of which were productive and yielded good 
      quality data. RESULTS: STOOL. In the lean population Bifidobacteria and Blautia 
      show a significant increase while taking Q-CAN®, and there was a trend for this 
      in the obese population. ORAL. There were relatively fewer major changes in the 
      oral microbiome with an increase in the family Veillonellaceae in the lean 
      population while on Q-CAN®. CONCLUSION: Q-CAN® consumption induced a number of 
      significant changes in the fecal and oral microbiome. Most notably an increase in 
      the stool microbiome of Bifidobacteria and Blautia, both of which are associated 
      with positive health benefits, and in the saliva an increase in Veillonellaceae. 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered with Clinicaltrials.gov on January 
      14th 2016. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02656056.

AB  - Increasingly available microbial reference data allow interpreting the 
      composition and function of previously uncharacterized microbial communities in 
      detail, via high-throughput sequencing analysis. However, efficient methods for 
      read classification are required when the best database matches for short 
      sequence reads are often shared among multiple reference sequences. Here, we take 
      advantage of the fact that microbial sequences can be annotated relative to 
      established tree structures, and we develop a highly scalable read classifier, 
      PRROMenade, by enhancing the generalized Burrows-Wheeler transform with a 
      labeling step to directly assign reads to the corresponding lowest taxonomic unit 
      in an annotation tree. PRROMenade solves the multi-matching problem while 
      allowing fast variable-size sequence classification for phylogenetic or 
      functional annotation. Our simulations with 5% added differences from reference 
      indicated only 1.5% error rate for PRROMenade functional classification. On 
      metatranscriptomic data PRROMenade highlighted biologically relevant functional 
      pathways related to diet-induced changes in the human gut microbiome.

TI  - Do the human gut metagenomic species possess the minimal set of core 
      functionalities necessary for life?
PG  - 678

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in bioinformatics recently allowed for the recovery of 
      'metagenomes assembled genomes' from human microbiome studies carried on with 
      shotgun sequencing techniques. Such approach is used as a mean to discover new 
      unclassified metagenomic species, putative biological entities having distinct 
      metabolic traits. RESULTS: In the present analysis we compare 400 genomes from 
      isolates available on NCBI database and 10,000 human gut metagenomic species, 
      screening all of them for the presence of a minimal set of core functionalities 
      necessary, but not sufficient, for life. As a result, the metagenome-assembled 
      genomes resulted systematically depleted in genes encoding for essential 
      functions apparently needed to support autonomous bacterial life. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The relevant degree of lacking core functionalities that we observed in 
      metagenome-assembled genomes raises some concerns about the effective 
      completeness of metagenome-assembled genomes, suggesting caution in extrapolating 
      biological information about their metabolic propensity and ecology in a complex 
      environment like the human gastrointestinal tract.

AB  - Assessment of bioinformatics tools for the metagenomics analysis from the whole 
      genome sequencing data requires realistic benchmark sets. We developed an 
      effective and simple generator of artificial metagenomes from real sequencing 
      experiments. The tool (SEQ2MGS) analyzes the input FASTQ files, precomputes 
      genomic content, and blends shotgun reads from different sequenced isolates, or 
      spike isolate(s) in real metagenome, in desired proportions. SEQ2MGS eliminates 
      the need for simulation of sequencing platform variations, reads distributions, 
      presence of plasmids, viruses, and contamination. The tool is especially useful 
      for a quick generation of multiple complex samples that include new or 
      understudied organisms, even without assembled genomes. For illustration, we 
      first demonstrated the ease of SEQ2MGS use for the simulation of altered 
      Schaedler flora (ASF) in comparison with de novo metagenomics generators Grinder 
      and CAMISIM. Next, we emulated the emergence of a pathogen in the human gut 
      microbiome and observed that Kraken, Centrifuge, and MetaPhlAn, while correctly 
      identified Klebsiella pneumoniae, produced inconsistent results for the rest of 
      real metagenome. Finally, using the MG-RAST platform, we affirmed that SEQ2MGS 
      properly transfers genomic information from an isolate into the simulated 
      metagenome by the correct identification of antimicrobial resistance genes 
      anticipated to appear compared to the original metagenome.

TI  - Isethionate is an intermediate in the degradation of sulfoacetate by the human 
      gut pathobiont Bilophila wadsworthia.

AB  - The obligately anaerobic sulfite-reducing bacterium Bilophila wadsworthia is a 
      common human pathobiont inhabiting the distal intestinal tract. It has a unique 
      ability to utilize a diverse range of food- and host-derived sulfonates to 
      generate sulfite as a terminal electron acceptor (TEA) for anaerobic respiration, 
      converting the sulfonate sulfur to H(2)S, implicated in inflammatory conditions 
      and colon cancer. The biochemical pathways involved in the metabolism of the C2 
      sulfonates isethionate and taurine by B. wadsworthia were recently reported. 
      However, its mechanism for metabolizing sulfoacetate, another prevalent C2 
      sulfonate, remained unknown. Here, we report bioinformatics investigations and 
      in vitro biochemical assays that uncover the molecular basis for the utilization 
      of sulfoacetate as a source of TEA (STEA) for B. wadsworthia, involving 
      conversion to sulfoacetyl-CoA by an ADP-forming sulfoacetate-CoA ligase (SauCD), 
      and stepwise reduction to isethionate by NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes 
      sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (SauS) and sulfoacetaldehyde reductase (TauF). 
      Isethionate is then cleaved by the O(2)-sensitive isethionate sulfolyase (IseG), 
      releasing sulfite for dissimilatory reduction to H(2)S. Sulfoacetate in different 
      environments originates from anthropogenic sources such as detergents, and 
      natural sources such as bacterial metabolism of the highly abundant 
      organosulfonates sulfoquinovose and taurine. Identification of enzymes for 
      anaerobic degradation of this relatively inert and electron-deficient C2 
      sulfonate provides further insights into sulfur recycling in the anaerobic 
      biosphere, including the human gut microbiome.

TI  - Minority species influences microbiota formation: the role of Bifidobacterium 
      with extracellular glycosidases in bifidus flora formation in breastfed infant 
      guts.
PG  - 259-264

AB  - The human body houses a variety of microbial ecosystems, such as the microbiotas 
      on the skin, in the oral cavity and in the digestive tract. The gut microbiota is 
      one such ecosystem that contains trillions of bacteria, and it is well 
      established that it can significantly influence host health and diseases. With 
      the advancement in bioinformatics tools, numerous comparative studies based on 
      16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, metabolomics, pathological and 
      epidemical analyses have revealed the correlative relationship between the 
      abundance of certain taxa and disease states or amount of certain causative 
      bioactive compounds. However, the 16S rRNA-based taxonomic analyses using 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology essentially detect only the majority 
      species. Although the entire gut microbiome consists of 10(13) microbial cells, 
      NGS read counts are given in multiples of 10(6) , making it difficult to 
      determine the diversity of the entire microbiota. Some recent studies have 
      reported instances where certain minority species play a critical role in 
      creating locally stable conditions for other species by stabilizing the 
      fundamental microbiota, despite their low abundance. These minority species act 
      as 'keystone species', which is a species whose effect on the community is 
      disproportionately large compared to its relative abundance. One of the 
      attributes of keystone species within the gut microbiota is its extensive 
      enzymatic capacity for substrates that are rare or difficult to degrade for other 
      species, such as dietary fibres or host-derived complex glycans, like human milk 
      oligosaccharides (HMOs). In this paper, we propose that more emphasis should be 
      placed on minority taxa and their possible role as keystone species in gut 
      microbiota studies by referring to our recent studies on HMO-mediated microbiota 
      formation in the infant gut.

PG  - ii56-ii61
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac468 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Bacteriophages and plasmids usually coexist with their host bacteria 
      in microbial communities and play important roles in microbial evolution. 
      Accurately identifying sequence contigs as phages, plasmids and bacterial 
      chromosomes in mixed metagenomic assemblies is critical for further unraveling 
      their functions. Many classification tools have been developed for identifying 
      either phages or plasmids in metagenomic assemblies. However, only two 
      classifiers, PPR-Meta and viralVerify, were proposed to simultaneously identify 
      phages and plasmids in mixed metagenomic assemblies. Due to the very high 
      fraction of chromosome contigs in the assemblies, both tools achieve high 
      precision in the classification of chromosomes but perform poorly in classifying 
      phages and plasmids. Short contigs in these assemblies are often wrongly 
      classified or classified as uncertain. RESULTS: Here we present 3CAC, a new 
      three-class classifier that improves the precision of phage and plasmid 
      classification. 3CAC starts with an initial three-class classification generated 
      by existing classifiers and improves the classification of short contigs and 
      contigs with low confidence classification by using proximity in the assembly 
      graph. Evaluation on simulated metagenomes and on real human gut microbiome 
      samples showed that 3CAC outperformed PPR-Meta and viralVerify in both precision 
      and recall, and increased F1-score by 10-60 percentage points. AVAILABILITY AND 
      IMPLEMENTATION: The 3CAC software is available on 
      https://github.com/Shamir-Lab/3CAC. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data 
      are available at Bioinformatics online.

AB  - MOTIVATION: The majority of data generated routinely from various experiments are 
      essentially multivariate, often categorized with multiple experimental metadata. 
      Analyzing such results with interactive visualizations often yields interesting 
      and intuitive results which otherwise remains undisclosed. RESULTS: In this 
      paper, we present Web-Igloo-a GUI based interactive 'feature decomposition 
      independent' multivariate data visualization platform. Web-Igloo is likely to be 
      a valuable contribution in the field of visual data mining, especially for 
      researchers working with but not limited to multi-omics data. To demonstrate its 
      utility, we have used a metagenomic dataset pertaining to the effect of multiple 
      doses of antibiotic treatment on the human gut microbiome. AVAILABILITY AND

AB  - BACKGROUND: A decade ago, the advancements in the microbiome data sequencing 
      techniques initiated the development of research of the microbiome and its 
      relationship with the host organism. The development of sophisticated 
      bioinformatics and data science tools for the analysis of large amounts of data 
      followed. Since then, the analyzed gut microbiome data, where microbiome is 
      defined as a network of microorganisms inhabiting the human intestinal system, 
      has been associated with several conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome - 
      IBS, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, and lately in 
      the study of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases as well. This paper aims to 
      provide an understanding of differences between microbial data of individuals who 
      have been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and those who were not by exploiting 
      data science techniques on publicly available data. METHODS: This study examines 
      the relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune central nervous 
      system disease, and gut microbial community composition, using the samples 
      acquired by 16s rRNA sequencing technique. We have used three different sets of 
      MS samples sequenced during three independent studies (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 
      7:1-11, 2016), (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015), (McDonald et al, 
      Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) and this approach strengthens our results. Analyzed 
      sequences were from healthy control and MS groups of sequences. The extracted set 
      of statistically significant bacteria from the (Jangi et al, Nat Commun 7:1-11, 
      2016) dataset samples and their statistically significant predictive functions 
      were used to develop a Random Forest classifier. In total, 8 models based on two 
      criteria: bacteria abundance (at six taxonomic levels) and predictive functions 
      (at two levels), were constructed and evaluated. These include using taxa 
      abundances at different taxonomy levels as well as predictive function analysis 
      at different hierarchical levels of KEGG pathways. RESULTS: The highest accuracy 
      of the classification model was obtained at the genus level of taxonomy (76.82%) 
      and the third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways (70.95%). The second dataset's 
      18 MS samples (Miyake et al, PLoS ONE 10:0137429, 2015) and 18 self-reported 
      healthy samples from the (McDonald et al, Msystems 3:00031-18, 2018) dataset were 
      used to validate the developed classification model. The significance of this 
      step is to show that the model is not overtrained for a specific dataset but can 
      also be used on other independent datasets. Again, the highest classification 
      model accuracy for both validating datasets combined was obtained at the genus 
      level of taxonomy (70.98%) and third hierarchical level of KEGG pathways 
      (67.24%). The accuracy of the independent set remained very relevant. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the developed classification model 
      provides a good tool that can be used to suggest the presence or absence of MS 
      condition by collecting and analyzing gut microbiome samples. The accuracy of the 
      model can be further increased by using sequencing methods that allow higher taxa 
      resolution (i.e. shotgun metagenomic sequencing).

TI  - Uncovering vector, parasite, blood meal and microbiome patterns from mixed-DNA 
      specimens of the Chagas disease vector Triatoma dimidiata.

AB  - Chagas disease, considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization, 
      is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and transmitted by >140 
      triatomine species across the Americas. In Central America, the main vector is 
      Triatoma dimidiata, an opportunistic blood meal feeder inhabiting both domestic 
      and sylvatic ecotopes. Given the diversity of interacting biological agents 
      involved in the epidemiology of Chagas disease, having simultaneous information 
      on the dynamics of the parasite, vector, the gut microbiome of the vector, and 
      the blood meal source would facilitate identifying key biotic factors associated 
      with the risk of T. cruzi transmission. In this study, we developed a 
      RADseq-based analysis pipeline to study mixed-species DNA extracted from T. 
      dimidiata abdomens. To evaluate the efficacy of the method across spatial scales, 
      we used a nested spatial sampling design that spanned from individual villages 
      within Guatemala to major biogeographic regions of Central America. Information 
      from each biotic source was distinguished with bioinformatics tools and used to 
      evaluate the prevalence of T. cruzi infection and predominant Discrete Typing 
      Units (DTUs) in the region, the population genetic structure of T. dimidiata, gut 
      microbial diversity, and the blood meal history. An average of 3.25 million reads 
      per specimen were obtained, with approximately 1% assigned to the parasite, 20% 
      to the vector, 11% to bacteria, and 4% to putative blood meals. Using a total of 
      6,405 T. cruzi SNPs, we detected nine infected vectors harboring two distinct 
      DTUs: TcI and a second unidentified strain, possibly TcIV. Vector specimens were 
      sufficiently variable for population genomic analyses, with a total of 25,710 T. 
      dimidiata SNPs across all samples that were sufficient to detect geographic 
      genetic structure at both local and regional scales. We observed a diverse 
      microbiotic community, with significantly higher bacterial species richness in 
      infected T. dimidiata abdomens than those that were not infected. Unifrac 
      analysis suggests a common assemblage of bacteria associated with infection, 
      which co-occurs with the typical gut microbial community derived from the local 
      environment. We identified vertebrate blood meals from five T. dimidiata 
      abdomens, including chicken, dog, duck and human; however, additional detection 
      methods would be necessary to confidently identify blood meal sources from most 
      specimens. Overall, our study shows this method is effective for simultaneously 
      generating genetic data on vectors and their associated parasites, along with 
      ecological information on feeding patterns and microbial interactions that may be 
      followed up with complementary approaches such as PCR-based parasite detection, 
      18S eukaryotic and 16S bacterial barcoding.

AB  - The Brucella melitensis chronic infection and drug resistance emerged as a severe 
      health problem in humans and domestic cattle. The pathogens fast genome sequences 
      availability fetched the possibility to address novel therapeutics targets in a 
      rationale way. We acquired the core genes set from 56 B. melitensis publically 
      available complete genome sequences. A stringent bioinformatics layout of 
      comparative genomics and reverse vaccinology was followed to identify potential 
      druggable proteins and multi-epitope vaccine constructs from core genes. The 23 
      proteins were shortlisted as novel druggable targets based on their role in 
      pathogen-specific metabolic pathways, non-homologous to human and human gut 
      microbiome proteins and their druggability potential. Furthermore, potential 
      chimeric vaccine constructs were generated from lead T and B-cell overlapped 
      epitopes in combination with immune enhancer adjuvants and linkers sequences. The 
      molecular docking and MD simulation analyses ensured stable molecular interaction 
      of a finally prioritized vaccine construct with human immune cells receptors.

TI  - MT-MAG: Accurate and interpretable machine learning for complete or partial 
      taxonomic assignments of metagenomeassembled genomes.

AB  - We propose MT-MAG, a novel machine learning-based software tool for the complete 
      or partial hierarchically-structured taxonomic classification of 
      metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). MT-MAG is alignment-free, with k-mer 
      frequencies being the only feature used to distinguish a DNA sequence from 
      another (herein k = 7). MT-MAG is capable of classifying large and diverse 
      metagenomic datasets: a total of 245.68 Gbp in the training sets, and 9.6 Gbp in 
      the test sets analyzed in this study. In addition to complete classifications, 
      MT-MAG offers a "partial classification" option, whereby a classification at a 
      higher taxonomic level is provided for MAGs that cannot be classified to the 
      Species level. MT-MAG outputs complete or partial classification paths, and 
      interpretable numerical classification confidences of its classifications, at all 
      taxonomic ranks. To assess the performance of MT-MAG, we define a "weighted 
      classification accuracy," with a weighting scheme reflecting the fact that 
      partial classifications at different ranks are not equally informative. For the 
      two benchmarking datasets analyzed (genomes from human gut microbiome species, 
      and bacterial and archaeal genomes assembled from cow rumen metagenomic 
      sequences), MT-MAG achieves an average of 87.32% in weighted classification 
      accuracy. At the Species level, MT-MAG outperforms DeepMicrobes, the only other 
      comparable software tool, by an average of 34.79% in weighted classification 
      accuracy. In addition, MT-MAG is able to completely classify an average of 67.70% 
      of the sequences at the Species level, compared with DeepMicrobes which only 
      classifies 47.45%. Moreover, MT-MAG provides additional information for sequences 
      that it could not classify at the Species level, resulting in the partial or 
      complete classification of 95.13%, of the genomes in the datasets analyzed. 
      Lastly, unlike other taxonomic assignment tools (e.g., GDTB-Tk), MT-MAG is an 
      alignment-free and genetic marker-free tool, able to provide additional 
      bioinformatics analysis to confirm existing or tentative taxonomic assignments.

TI  - TaxiBGC: a Taxonomy-Guided Approach for Profiling Experimentally Characterized 
      Microbial Biosynthetic Gene Clusters and Secondary Metabolite Production 
      Potential in Metagenomes.
PG  - e0092522
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00925-22 [doi]
LID - e00925-22
AB  - Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in microbial genomes encode bioactive secondary 
      metabolites (SMs), which can play important roles in microbe-microbe and 
      host-microbe interactions. Given the biological significance of SMs and the 
      current profound interest in the metabolic functions of microbiomes, the unbiased 
      identification of BGCs from high-throughput metagenomic data could offer novel 
      insights into the complex chemical ecology of microbial communities. Currently 
      available tools for predicting BGCs from shotgun metagenomes have several 
      limitations, including the need for computationally demanding read assembly, 
      predicting a narrow breadth of BGC classes, and not providing the SM product. To 
      overcome these limitations, we developed taxonomy-guided identification of 
      biosynthetic gene clusters (TaxiBGC), a command-line tool for predicting 
      experimentally characterized BGCs (and inferring their known SMs) in metagenomes 
      by first pinpointing the microbial species likely to harbor them. We benchmarked 
      TaxiBGC on various simulated metagenomes, showing that our taxonomy-guided 
      approach could predict BGCs with much-improved performance (mean F(1) score, 
      0.56; mean PPV score, 0.80) compared with directly identifying BGCs by mapping 
      sequencing reads onto the BGC genes (mean F(1) score, 0.49; mean PPV score, 
      0.41). Next, by applying TaxiBGC on 2,650 metagenomes from the Human Microbiome 
      Project and various case-control gut microbiome studies, we were able to 
      associate BGCs (and their SMs) with different human body sites and with multiple 
      diseases, including Crohn's disease and liver cirrhosis. In all, TaxiBGC provides 
      an in silico platform to predict experimentally characterized BGCs and their SM 
      production potential in metagenomic data while demonstrating important advantages 
      over existing techniques. IMPORTANCE Currently available bioinformatics tools to 
      identify BGCs from metagenomic sequencing data are limited in their predictive 
      capability or ease of use to even computationally oriented researchers. We 
      present an automated computational pipeline called TaxiBGC, which predicts 
      experimentally characterized BGCs (and infers their known SMs) in shotgun 
      metagenomes by first considering the microbial species source. Through rigorous 
      benchmarking techniques on simulated metagenomes, we show that TaxiBGC provides a 
      significant advantage over existing methods. When demonstrating TaxiBGC on 
      thousands of human microbiome samples, we associate BGCs encoding bacteriocins 
      with different human body sites and diseases, thereby elucidating a possible 
      novel role of this antibiotic class in maintaining the stability of microbial 
      ecosystems throughout the human body. Furthermore, we report for the first time 
      gut microbial BGC associations shared among multiple pathologies. Ultimately, we 
      expect our tool to facilitate future investigations into the chemical ecology of 
      microbial communities across diverse niches and pathologies.

TI  - Neonatal Exposure to BPA, BDE-99, and PCB Produces Persistent Changes in Hepatic 
      Transcriptome Associated With Gut Dysbiosis in Adult Mouse Livers.
PG  - 83-103
LID - 10.1093/toxsci/kfab104 [doi]
AB  - Recent evidence suggests that complex diseases can result from early life 
      exposure to environmental toxicants. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and 
      polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and 
      remain a continuing risk to human health despite being banned from production. 
      Developmental BPA exposure mediated-adult onset of liver cancer via epigenetic 
      reprogramming mechanisms has been identified. Here, we investigated whether the 
      gut microbiome and liver can be persistently reprogrammed following neonatal 
      exposure to POPs, and the associations between microbial biomarkers and 
      disease-prone changes in the hepatic transcriptome in adulthood, compared with 
      BPA. C57BL/6 male and female mouse pups were orally administered vehicle, BPA, 
      BDE-99 (a breast milk-enriched PBDE congener), or the Fox River PCB mixture 
      (PCBs), once daily for three consecutive days (postnatal days [PND] 2-4). Tissues 
      were collected at PND5 and PND60. Among the three chemicals investigated, early 
      life exposure to BDE-99 produced the most prominent developmental reprogramming 
      of the gut-liver axis, including hepatic inflammatory and cancer-prone 
      signatures. In adulthood, neonatal BDE-99 exposure resulted in a persistent 
      increase in Akkermansia muciniphila throughout the intestine, accompanied by 
      increased hepatic levels of acetate and succinate, the known products of A. 
      muciniphila. In males, this was positively associated with permissive epigenetic 
      marks H3K4me1 and H3K27, which were enriched in loci near liver cancer-related 
      genes that were dysregulated following neonatal exposure to BDE-99. Our findings 
      provide novel insights that early life exposure to POPs can have a life-long 
      impact on disease risk, which may partly be regulated by the gut microbiome.

TI  - Metagenomics of Two Severe Foodborne Outbreaks Provides Diagnostic Signatures and 
      Signs of Coinfection Not Attainable by Traditional Methods.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02577-16 [doi]
LID - e02577-16
AB  - Diagnostic testing for foodborne pathogens relies on culture-based techniques 
      that are not rapid enough for real-time disease surveillance and do not give a 
      quantitative picture of pathogen abundance or the response of the natural 
      microbiome. Powerful sequence-based culture-independent approaches, such as 
      shotgun metagenomics, could sidestep these limitations and potentially reveal a 
      pathogen-specific signature on the microbiome that would have implications not 
      only for diagnostics but also for better understanding disease progression and 
      pathogen ecology. However, metagenomics have not yet been validated for foodborne 
      pathogen detection. Toward closing these gaps, we applied shotgun metagenomics to 
      stool samples collected from two geographically isolated (Alabama and Colorado) 
      foodborne outbreaks, where the etiologic agents were identified by 
      culture-dependent methods as distinct strains of Salmonella enterica subsp. 
      enterica serovar Heidelberg. Metagenomic investigations were consistent with the 
      culture-based findings and revealed, in addition, the in situ abundance and level 
      of intrapopulation diversity of the pathogen, the possibility of coinfections 
      with Staphylococcus aureus, overgrowth of commensal Escherichia coli, and 
      significant shifts in the gut microbiome during infection relative to reference 
      healthy samples. Additionally, we designed our bioinformatics pipeline to deal 
      with several challenges associated with the analysis of clinical samples, such as 
      the high frequency of coeluting human DNA sequences and assessment of the 
      virulence potential of pathogens. Comparisons of these results to those of other 
      studies revealed that in several, but not all, cases of diarrheal outbreaks, the 
      disease and healthy states of the gut microbial community might be 
      distinguishable, opening new possibilities for diagnostics. IMPORTANCE: 
      Diagnostic testing for enteric pathogens has relied for decades on culture-based 
      techniques, but a total of 38.4 million cases of foodborne illness per year 
      cannot be attributed to specific causes. This study describes new 
      culture-independent metagenomic approaches and the associated bioinformatics 
      pipeline to detect and type the causative agents of microbial disease with 
      unprecedented accuracy, opening new possibilities for the future development of 
      health technologies and diagnostics. Our tools and approaches should be 
      applicable to other microbial diseases in addition to foodborne diarrhea.

AB  - In order for human microbiome studies to translate into actionable outcomes for 
      health, meta-analysis of reproducible data from population-scale cohorts is 
      needed. Achieving sufficient reproducibility in microbiome research has proven 
      challenging. We report a baseline investigation of variability in taxonomic 
      profiling for the Microbiome Quality Control (MBQC) project baseline study 
      (MBQC-base). Blinded specimen sets from human stool, chemostats, and artificial 
      microbial communities were sequenced by 15 laboratories and analyzed using nine 
      bioinformatics protocols. Variability depended most on biospecimen type and 
      origin, followed by DNA extraction, sample handling environment, and 
      bioinformatics. Analysis of artificial community specimens revealed differences 
      in extraction efficiency and bioinformatic classification. These results may 
      guide researchers in experimental design choices for gut microbiome studies.

TI  - DACE: a scalable DP-means algorithm for clustering extremely large sequence data.
PG  - 834-842
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btw722 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Advancements in next-generation sequencing technology have produced 
      large amounts of reads at low cost in a short time. In metagenomics, 16S and 18S 
      rRNA gene have been widely used as marker genes to profile diversity of 
      microorganisms in environmental samples. Through clustering of sequencing reads 
      we can determine both number of OTUs and their relative abundance. In many 
      applications, clustering of very large sequencing data with high efficiency and 
      accuracy is essential for downstream analysis. RESULTS: Here, we report a 
      scalable D irichlet Process Means (DP-means) a lgorithm for c lustering e 
      xtremely large sequencing data, termed . With an efficient random projection 
      partition strategy for parallel clustering, DACE can cluster billions of 
      sequences within a couple of hours. Experimental results show that DACE runs 
      between 6 and 80 times faster than state-of-the-art programs, while maintaining 
      overall better clustering accuracy. Using 80 cores, DACE clustered the Lake Taihu 
      16S rRNA gene sequencing data (∼316M reads, 30 GB) in 25 min, and the Ocean TARA 
      Eukaryotic 18S rRNA gene sequencing data (∼500M reads, 88 GB) into ∼100 000 
      clusters within an hour. When applied to the IGC gene catalogs in human gut 
      microbiome (∼10M genes), DACE produced 9.8M clusters with 52K redundant genes in 
      1.5 hours of running time. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DACE is available at 
      https://github.com/tinglab/DACE . CONTACTS: tingchen@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn or 
      ningchen@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are

AB  - The potential therapeutic effects of probiotic bacteria in rheumatoid arthritis 
      (RA) remain controversial. Thus, this study aimed to discover potential 
      therapeutic bacteria based on the relationship between the gut microbiome and 
      rheumatoid factor (RF) in RA. Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from the fecal 
      samples of 93 RA patients and 16 healthy subjects. Microbiota profiling was 
      conducted through 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses. The effects of 
      Bifidobacterium strains on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 
      collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were assessed. Significant differences in 
      gut microbiota composition were observed in patients with different RF levels. 
      The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Collinsella was lower in RF-high 
      than in RF-low and RF-negative RA patients, while the relative abundance of 
      Clostridium of Ruminococcaceae family was higher in RF-high than in RF-low and 
      RF-negative patients. Among 10 differentially abundant Bifidobacterium, B. longum 
      RAPO exhibited the strongest ability to inhibit IL-17 secretion. Oral 
      administration of B. longum RAPO in CIA mice, obese CIA, and humanized avatar 
      model significantly reduced RA incidence, arthritis score, inflammation, bone 
      damage, cartilage damage, Th17 cells, and inflammatory cytokine secretion. 
      Additionally, B. longum RAPO significantly inhibited Th17 cells and Th17-related 
      genes-IL-17A, IRF4, RORC, IL-21, and IL-23R-in the PBMCs of rheumatoid arthritis 
      patients. Our findings suggest that B. longum RAPO may alleviate RA by inhibiting 
      the production of IL-17 and other proinflammatory mediators. The safety and 
      efficacy of B. longum RAPO in patients with RA and other autoimmune disorders 
      merit further investigation.

AB  - The present study investigated the water quality index, microbial composition and 
      antimicrobial resistance genes in urban water habitats. Combined chemicals 
      testing, metagenomic analyses and qualitative PCR (qPCR) were conducted on 20 
      locations, including rivers from hospital surrounds (n = 7), community surrounds 
      (n = 7), and natural wetlands (n = 6). Results showed that the indexes of total 
      nitrogen, phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen of hospital waters were 2-3 folds high 
      than that of water from wetlands. Bioinformatics analysis revealed a total of 
      1,594 bacterial species from 479 genera from the three groups of water samples. 
      The hospital-related samples had the greatest number of unique genera, followed 
      by those from wetlands and communities. The hospital-related samples contained a 
      large number of bacteria associated with the gut microbiome, including Alistipes, 
      Prevotella, Klebsiella, Escherichia, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium, which 
      were all significantly enriched compared to samples from the wetlands. 
      Nevertheless, the wetland waters enriched bacteria from Nanopelagicus, 
      Mycolicibacterium and Gemmatimonas, which are typically associated with aquatic 
      environments. The presence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) that were 
      associated with different species origins in each water sample was observed. The 
      majority of ARGs from hospital-related samples were carried by bacteria from 
      Acinetobacter, Aeromonas and various genera from Enterobacteriaceae, which each 
      was associated with multiple ARGs. In contrast, the ARGs that were exclusively in 
      samples from communities and wetlands were carried by species that encoded only 1 
      to 2 ARGs each and were not normally associated with human infections. The qPCR 
      showed that water samples of hospital surrounds had higher concentrations of 
      intI1 and antimicrobial resistance genes such as tetA, ermA, ermB, qnrB, sul1, 
      sul2 and other beta-lactam genes. Further genes of functional metabolism reported 
      that the enrichment of genes associated with the degradation/utilization of 
      nitrate and organic phosphodiester were detected in water samples around 
      hospitals and communities compared to those from wetlands. Finally, correlations 
      between the water quality indicators and the number of ARGs were evaluated. The 
      presence of total nitrogen, phosphorus, and ammonia nitrogen were significantly 
      correlated with the presence of ermA and sul1. Furthermore, intI1 exhibited a 
      significant correlation with ermB, sul1, and bla(SHV), indicating a prevalence of 
      ARGs in urban water environments might be due to the integron intI1's 
      diffusion-promoting effect. However, the high abundance of ARGs was limited to 
      the waters around the hospital, and we did not observe the geographical transfer 
      of ARGs along with the river flow. This may be related to water purifying 
      capacity of natural riverine wetlands. Taken together, continued surveillance is 
      required to assess the risk of bacterial horizontal transmission and its 
      potential impact on public health in the current region.

AB  - We report the first use of constraint-based microbial community modeling on a 
      single individual with episodic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, who 
      has a well documented set of colonic inflammatory biomarkers, as well as 
      metagenomically-sequenced fecal time series covering seven dates over 16 months. 
      Between the first two time steps the individual was treated with both steroids 
      and antibiotics. Our methodology enabled us to identify numerous time-correlated 
      microbial species and metabolites. We found that the individual's dynamical 
      microbial ecology in the disease state led to time-varying in silico 
      overproduction, compared to healthy controls, of more than 24 biologically 
      important metabolites, including methane, thiamine, formaldehyde, trimethylamine 
      N-oxide, folic acid, serotonin, histamine, and tryptamine. The microbe-metabolite 
      contribution analysis revealed that some Dialister species changed metabolic 
      pathways according to the inflammation phases. At the first time point, 
      characterized by the highest levels of serum (complex reactive protein) and fecal 
      (calprotectin) inflammation biomarkers, they produced L-serine or formate. The 
      production of the compounds, through a cascade effect, was mediated by the 
      interaction with pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and Desulfovibrio piger. We 
      integrated the microbial community metabolic models of each time point with a 
      male whole-body, organ-resolved model of human metabolism to track the metabolic 
      consequences of dysbiosis at different body sites. The presence of D. piger in 
      the gut microbiome influenced the sulfur metabolism with a domino effect 
      affecting the liver. These results revealed large longitudinal variations in an 
      individual's gut microbiome ecology and metabolite production, potentially 
      impacting other organs in the body. Future simulations with more time points from 
      an individual could permit us to assess how external drivers, such as diet change 
      or medical interventions, drive microbial community dynamics.

AB  - The individual risk of contracting multiple sclerosis (MS) is determined by 
      genetic predisposition as well as environmental factors. In monozygotic twins the 
      concordance rate for MS is approximately 30 % indicating that environmental 
      factors are even more important than genetic factors. Observations in a T-cell 
      receptor-transgenic, spontaneous mouse model strongly point to an important 
      contribution of the individual gut microbiome (microbiota). Mice maintained in a 
      germ-free environment are completely protected from experimental autoimmune 
      encephalomyelitis (EAE) in this model, whereas mice that are kept under normal 
      conditions spontaneously develop a relapsing-remitting central nervous system 
      (CNS) disease which is astoundingly similar to human MS. It appears that the 
      autoimmune reaction against CNS tissue is "remotely controlled" by the gut 
      microbiota. This may be explained by the facts that the microbiota influences the 
      gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and, vice versa, the GALT regulates 
      systemic immunity. The precise role of the microbiota in MS remains to be 
      clarified. New methods of DNA sequencing and bioinformatics allow the analysis of 
      very complex bacterial metagenomes. If individual microbial risk profiles can be 
      identified this would provide completely new perspectives for the prophylaxis and 
      therapy of MS.

TI  - IBDsite: a Galaxy-interacting, integrative database for supporting inflammatory 
      bowel disease high throughput data analysis.
PG  - S5
LID - 10.1186/1471-2105-13-S14-S5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) refer to a group of inflammatory 
      conditions concerning colon and small intestine, which cause socially 
      uncomfortable symptoms and often are associated with an increased risk of colon 
      cancer. IBD are complex disorders, which rely on genetic susceptibility, 
      environmental factors, deregulation of the immune system, and host relationship 
      with commensal microbiota. The complexity of these pathologies makes difficult to 
      clearly understand the mechanisms of their onset. Therefore, the study of IBD 
      must be faced exploiting an integrated and multilevel approach, ranging from 
      genes, transcripts and proteins to pathways altered in affected tissues, and 
      carefully considering their regulatory mechanisms, which may intervene in the 
      pathology onset. It is also crucial to have a knowledge base about the symbiotic 
      bacteria that are hosted in the human gut. To date, much data exist regarding IBD 
      and human commensal bacteria, but this information is sparse in literature and no 
      free resource provides a homogeneously and rationally integrated view of 
      biomolecular data related to these pathologies. METHODS: Human genes altered in 
      IBD have been collected from literature, paying particular interest for the 
      immune system alterations prompted by the interaction with the gut microbiome. 
      This process has been performed manually to assure the reliability of collected 
      data. Heterogeneous metadata from different sources have been automatically 
      formatted and integrated in order to enrich information about these altered 
      genes. A user-friendly web interface has been created for easy access to 
      structured data. Tools such as gene clustering coefficients, all-pairs shortest 
      paths and pathway lengths calculation have been developed to provide data 
      analysis support. Moreover, the implemented resource is compliant to the Galaxy 
      framework, allowing the collected data to be exploited in the context of high 
      throughput bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: To fill the lack of a reference 
      resource for 'omics' science analysis in the context of IBD, we developed the 
      IBDsite (available at http://www.itb.cnr.it/ibd), a disease-oriented platform, 
      which collects data related to biomolecular mechanisms involved in the IBD onset. 
      The resource provides a section devoted to human genes identified as altered in 
      IBD, which can be queried at different biomolecular levels and visualised in 
      gene-centred report pages. Furthermore, the system presents information related 
      to the gut microbiota involved in IBD affected patients. The IBDsite is compliant 
      with all Galaxy installations (in particular, it can be accessed from our custom 
      version of Galaxy, http://www.itb.cnr.it/galaxy), in order to facilitate 
      high-throughput data integration and to enable evaluations of the genomic basis 
      of these diseases, complementing the tools embedded in the IBDsite. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Lots of sparse data exist concerning IBD studies, but no on-line resource 
      homogeneously and rationally integrate and collect them. The IBDsite is an 
      attempt to group available information regarding human genes and microbial 
      aspects related to IBD, by means of a multilevel mining tool. Moreover, it 
      constitutes a knowledge base to filter, annotate and understand new experimental 
      data in order to formulate new scientific hypotheses, thanks to the possibility 
      of integrating genomics aspects by employing the Galaxy framework. Discussed 
      use-cases demonstrate that the developed system is useful to infer not trivial 
      knowledge from the existing widespread data or from novel experiments.

TI  - Metagenomics as a Public Health Risk Assessment Tool in a Study of Natural Creek 
      Sediments Influenced by Agricultural and Livestock Runoff: Potential and 
      Limitations.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02525-19 [doi]
LID - e02525-19
AB  - Little is known about the public health risks associated with natural creek 
      sediments that are affected by runoff and fecal pollution from agricultural and 
      livestock practices. For instance, the persistence of foodborne pathogens such as 
      Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) originating from these practices 
      remains poorly quantified. Towards closing these knowledge gaps, the 
      water-sediment interface of two creeks in the Salinas River Valley of California 
      was sampled over a 9-month period using metagenomics and traditional 
      culture-based tests for STEC. Our results revealed that these sediment 
      communities are extremely diverse and have functional and taxonomic diversity 
      comparable to that observed in soils. With our sequencing effort (∼4 Gbp per 
      library), we were unable to detect any pathogenic E. coli in the metagenomes of 
      11 samples that had tested positive using culture-based methods, apparently due 
      to relatively low abundance. Furthermore, there were no significant differences 
      in the abundance of human- or cow-specific gut microbiome sequences in the 
      downstream impacted sites compared to that in upstream more pristine (control) 
      sites, indicating natural dilution of anthropogenic inputs. Notably, the high 
      number of metagenomic reads carrying antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) found in 
      all samples was significantly higher than ARG reads in other available freshwater 
      and soil metagenomes, suggesting that these communities may be natural reservoirs 
      of ARGs. The work presented here should serve as a guide for sampling volumes, 
      amount of sequencing to apply, and what bioinformatics analyses to perform when 
      using metagenomics for public health risk studies of environmental samples such 
      as sediments.IMPORTANCE Current agricultural and livestock practices contribute 
      to fecal contamination in the environment and the spread of food- and waterborne 
      disease and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Traditionally, the level of 
      pollution and risk to public health are assessed by culture-based tests for the 
      intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli However, the accuracy of these traditional 
      methods (e.g., low accuracy in quantification, and false-positive signal when PCR 
      based) and their suitability for sediments remain unclear. We collected sediments 
      for a time series metagenomics study from one of the most highly productive 
      agricultural regions in the United States in order to assess how agricultural 
      runoff affects the native microbial communities and if the presence of Shiga 
      toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in sediment samples can be detected 
      directly by sequencing. Our study provided important information on the potential 
      for using metagenomics as a tool for assessment of public health risk in natural 
      environments.

      combination of best-match and phylogenetic approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metagenomic datasets provide an opportunity to study horizontal gene 
      transfer (HGT) on the level of a microbial community. However, current HGT 
      detection methods cannot be applied to community-level datasets or require 
      reference genomes. Here, we present MetaCHIP, a pipeline for 
      reference-independent HGT identification at the community level. RESULTS: 
      Assessment of MetaCHIP's performance on simulated datasets revealed that it can 
      predict HGTs with various degrees of genetic divergence from metagenomic 
      datasets. The results also indicated that the detection of very recent gene 
      transfers (i.e. those with low levels of genetic divergence) from metagenomics 
      datasets is largely affected by the read assembly step. Comparison of MetaCHIP 
      with a previous analysis on soil bacteria showed a high level of consistency for 
      the prediction of recent HGTs and revealed a large number of additional 
      non-recent gene transfers, which can provide new biological and ecological 
      insight. Assessment of MetaCHIP's performance on real metagenomic datasets 
      confirmed the role of HGT in the spread of genes related to antibiotic resistance 
      in the human gut microbiome. Further testing also showed that functions related 
      to energy production and conversion as well as carbohydrate transport and 
      metabolism are frequently transferred among free-living microorganisms. 
      CONCLUSION: MetaCHIP provides an opportunity to study HGTs among members of a 
      microbial community and therefore has several applications in the field of 
      microbial ecology and evolution. MetaCHIP is implemented in Python and freely 
      available at https://github.com/songweizhi/MetaCHIP .

TI  - NINJA-OPS: Fast Accurate Marker Gene Alignment Using Concatenated Ribosomes.
PG  - e1004658

AB  - The explosion of bioinformatics technologies in the form of next generation 
      sequencing (NGS) has facilitated a massive influx of genomics data in the form of 
      short reads. Short read mapping is therefore a fundamental component of next 
      generation sequencing pipelines which routinely match these short reads against 
      reference genomes for contig assembly. However, such techniques have seldom been 
      applied to microbial marker gene sequencing studies, which have mostly relied on 
      novel heuristic approaches. We propose NINJA Is Not Just Another OTU-Picking 
      Solution (NINJA-OPS, or NINJA for short), a fast and highly accurate novel method 
      enabling reference-based marker gene matching (picking Operational Taxonomic 
      Units, or OTUs). NINJA takes advantage of the Burrows-Wheeler (BW) alignment 
      using an artificial reference chromosome composed of concatenated reference 
      sequences, the "concatesome," as the BW input. Other features include automatic 
      support for paired-end reads with arbitrary insert sizes. NINJA is also free and 
      open source and implements several pre-filtering methods that elicit substantial 
      speedup when coupled with existing tools. We applied NINJA to several published 
      microbiome studies, obtaining accuracy similar to or better than previous 
      reference-based OTU-picking methods while achieving an order of magnitude or more 
      speedup and using a fraction of the memory footprint. NINJA is a complete 
      pipeline that takes a FASTA-formatted input file and outputs a QIIME-formatted 
      taxonomy-annotated BIOM file for an entire MiSeq run of human gut microbiome 16S 
      genes in under 10 minutes on a dual-core laptop.
